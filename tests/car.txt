What is the main challenge in identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs that the Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) method aims to address? 
How does the PQK method operate to predict CAR T-cell cytotoxicity, and what kind of hardware was used for its largest application to date? 
What are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, and how do their co-stimulatory domains influence their function? 
What is the significance of the "combinatorial motif space" in CAR T-cell design, and why is it challenging to explore experimentally? 
How do the g cq â€‹and model complexity (Sc and Sq) metrics help assess the potential for quantum prediction advantage in a machine learning task? 
How did the performance of PQK (E1) data compare to the original data in classifying CAR T-cells for high and low cytotoxicity, particularly with increasing feature map repetitions? 
Why does the predictive performance of PQK decrease when the number of feature map repetitions increases beyond a certain point? 
In what specific scenarios or for which motif positions did the PQK-based classifier demonstrate significantly improved predictive performance compared to using the original data? 
What are the key limitations of classical machine learning methods when applied to problems like CAR T-cell intracellular signaling domain optimization? 
What are the challenges in applying PQK to a regression task on near-term quantum hardware, and why are classification tasks currently more suitable?
