Prompt sent:
that   he   had   brought   the   demonstration   to  perfection.   In   November,   Dr.   Halley   received   a   copy   of   the  work   ;   and,   in   the   following   month^   announced   .   it   to   the   Royal  Society,   with   the   author's   promise   to   have   it   entered   upon   their  Register.   Newton,   subsequently   reminded   by   the   Society   of   his  promise,   proceeded   in   the   diligent   preparation   of   the   work,   and.  though   suffering   an   interruption   of   six   weeks,   transmitted   the  manuscript   of   the   first   book   to   London   before   the   end   of   April.  The   work   was   entitled   PHILOSOPHI/E   NATURALIS   PRINCIPIA  MATHEMATICA,   dedicated   to   the   Royal   Society,   and   presented  thereto   on   the   28th   of   April,   1685-6.   The   highest   encomiums  were   passed   upon   it  ;   and   the   council   resolved,   on   the   19th   of  May,   to   print   it   at   the   expense   of   the   Society,   and   under   the   di  rection   of   Dr.   Halley.   The   latter,   a   few   days   afterward,   com  municated   these   steps   to   Newton,   who,   in   a   reply,   dated   the   20th  of   June,   holds   the   following   language   :  "   The   proof   you   sent   me  I   like   very   well.   I   designed   the   whole   to   consist   of   three   books   ;  the   second   was   finished   last   summer,   being   short,   and   only   wants  transcribing,   and   drawing   the   cuts   fairly.   Some   new   propositions  I   have   since   thought   on,   which   I   can   as   well   let   alone.   The  third   wants   the   theory   of   comets.   In   autumn   last,   I   spent   two  months   in   calculation   to   no   purpose   for   want   of   a   good   method,  which   made   me   afterward   return   to   the   first   book,   and   enlarge   it  with   diverse   propositions,   some*   relating   to   comets,   others   to   other  things   found   ouf   last   winter.   The   third   I   now   design   to   sup  press.   Philosophy   is   such   an   impertinently   litigious   lady,   that   a  man   had   as   good   be   engaged   in   as   have   to   do   with   her.  I   found   it   so   formerly,   and   now   I   can   no   sooner   come   near   her  again,   but   she   gives   me   warning.   The   first   two   books   without  the   third   will   not   so   well   bear   the   title   of   P/iilosophicc   Naturalis  3

But   after   second   thought   I   re  tain   the   former   title.   It   will   help   the   sale   of   the   book,   which   I  ought   not   to   diminish   now   'tis   yours."  This   "   warning"   arose   from   some   pretensions   put   forth   by   Dr.  Hooke.   And   though   Newton   gave   a   minute   and   positive   refuta  tions   of   such   claims,   yet,   to   reconcile   all   differences,   he   gener  ously   added   to   Prop.   IV.   Cor.   6,   Book   I,   a   Scholium,   in   which  Wren,   Hooke   and   Halley   are   acknowledged   to   have   indepen  dently   deduced   the   law   of   gravity   from   the   second   law   of  Kepler.  The   suppression   of   the   third   book   Dr.   Halley   could   not   endure  to   see.   "   I   must   again   beg   you"   says   he,   "   not   to   let   your   re  sentments   run   so   high   as   to   deprive   us   of   your   third   book,   where  in   your   applications   of   your   mathematical   doctrine   to   the   theory  of   comets,   and   several   curious   experiments,   which,   as   I   guess   by  what   you   write   ought   to   compose   it,   will   undoubtedly   render   it  acceptable   to   those   who   will   call   themselves   philosophers   without  mathematics,   which   are   much   the   greater   number."   To   these  solicitations   Newton   yielded.   There   were   no   "resentments,"   how  ever,   as   we   conceive,   in   his   "   design   to   suppress."   He   sought  peace   ;   for   he   loved   and   valued   it   above   all   applause.   But,   in  spite   of   his   efforts   for   tranquillity's   sake,   his   course   of   discovery  was   all   along   molested   by   ignorance   or   presumptuous   rivalry.  The   publication   of   the   great   work   now   went   rapidly   forwards,  The   second   book   was   sent   to   the   Society,   and   presented   on   the  2d   March   ;   the   third,   on   the   6th   April  ;   and   the   whole   was   com  pleted   and   published   in   the   month   of   May,   1686-7.   In   the   sec  ond   Lemma   of   the   second   book,   the   fundamental   principle   of   his  fiuxionary   calculus   was,   for   the   first   time,   given   to   the   world  ;   but  its   algorithm   or   notation   did   not   appear   till   published   in   the  second   volume   nf   Dr.   Wallis's   works,   in   1693.  And   thus   was   ushered   into   existence   The   PRINCIPIA  a   work  to   which   pre-eminence   above   all   the   productions   of   the   human  intellect   has   been   awarded  a   work   that   must   be   esteemed   of  priceless   worth   so   long   as   Science   has   a   votary,   or   a   single   wor  shipper   be   left   to   kneel   at   the   altar   of   Truth.

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   33  The   entire   work   bears   the   general   title   of   THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES   OF   NATURAL   PHILOSOPHY.   It   consists   of   three   books:  the   first   two,   entitled,   OF   THE   MOTION   OF   BODIES,   are   occupied  with   the   laws   and   conditions   of   motions   and   forces,   and   are   illus  trated   with   many   scholia   treating   of   some   of   the   most   general  and   best   established   points   in   philosophy,   such   as   the   density   and  resistance   of   bodies,   spaces   void   of   matter,   and   the   motion   of  sound   and   light.   From   these   principles,   there   is   deduced,   in   the  third   book,   drawn   up   in   as   popular   a   style   as   possible   and   entitled,  OF   THE   SYSTEM   OF   THE   WORLD,   the   constitution   of   the   system   of  i  he   world.   In   regard   to   this   book,   the   author   say^   "   I   had,   indeed,  composed   the   third   Book   in   a   popular   method,   that   it   might   be   read  by   many  ;   but   afterwards,   considering   that   such   as   had   not   suf-  ficently   entered   into   the   principles   could   not   easily   discover   the  strength   of   the   consequences,   nor   lay   aside   the   prejudices   to   which  they   had   been   many   years   accustomed,   therefore,   to   prevent   dis  putes   which   might   be   raised   upon   such   accounts,   I   chose   to   reduce  the   substance   of   this   Book   into   the   form   of   Propositions   (in   the  mathematical   way),   which   should   be   read   by   those   only   who   had  first   made   themselves   masters   of   the   principles   established   in   the  preceding   Books   :   not   that   I   would   advise   any   one   to   the   previous  study   of   every   Proposition   of   those   Books."  "It   is   enough   it  one   carefully   reads   the   Definitions,   the   Laws   of   Motion,   and   the  three   first   Sections   of   the   first   Book.   He   may   then   pass   on   to  this   Book,   and   consult   such   of   the   remaining   Propositions   of   the  first   two   Books,   as   the   references   in   this,   and   his   occasions   shall   re  quire."   So   that   "   The   System   of   the   World"   is   composed   both  "   in   a   popular   method,"   and   in   the   form   of   mathematical   Propo  sitions.  The   principle   of   Universal   Gravi'   ition,   namely,   that   every  particle   of   matter   is   attracted   by,   or   gravitates   to,   every   other  particle   of   matter,   icith   a   force   inversely   proportional   to   the  squares   of   their   distances  is   the   discovery   w?   ich   characterizes  The   PRINCIPIA.   This   principle   the   author   deduced   from   the   mo  tion   of   the   moon,   and   the   three   laws   of   Kepler  laws,   which  Newton,   in   turn,   by   his   greater   law,   demonstrated   to   be   true.  From   the   first   law   of   Kepler,   namely,   the    proportionality   of

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  the   areas   to   t\ie   times   of   their   description,   our   author   inferred  that   the   force   which   retained   the   planet   in   its   orbit   was   always  directed   to   the   sun  ;   and   from   the   second,   namely,   that   every  planet   moves   in   an   ellipse   with   the   sun   in   one   of   its   foci,   he   drew  the   more   general   inference   that   the   force   by   which   the   planet  moves   round   that   focus   varies   inversely   as   the   square   of   its   dis  tance   therefrom   :   and   he   demonstrated   that   a   planet   acted   upon  by   such   a   force   could   not   move   in   any   other   curve   than   a   conic  section  ;   showing   when   the   moving   body   would   describe   a   circu  lar,   an   elliptical,   a   parabolic,   or   hyperbolic   orbit.   He   demon  strated,   too,   that   this   force,   or   attracting,   gravitating   power   re  sided   in   every,   the   least   particle  ;   but   that,   in   spherical   masses,   it  operated   as   if   confined   to   their   centres  ;   so   that,   one   sphere   or  body   will   act   upon   another   sphere   or   body,   with   a   force   directly  proportional   to   the   quantity   of   matter,   and   inversely   as   the   square  of   the   distance   between   their   centres;   and   that   their   velocities   of  mutual   approach   will   be   in   the   inverse   ratio   of   their   quantities   o*'  matter.   Thus   he   grandly   outlined   the   Universal   Law.   Verify  ing   its   truth   by   the   motions   of   terrestrial   bodies,   then   by   those   of  the   moon   and   other   secondary   orbs,   he   finally   embraced,   in   one  mighty   generalization,   the   entire   Solar   System  all   the   move  ments   of   all   its   bodies  planets,   satellites   and   comets  explain  ing   and   harmonizing   the   many   diverse   and   theretofore   inexplica  ble   phenomena.  Guided   by   the   genius   of   Newton,   we   see   sphere   bound   to  sphere,   body   to   body,   particle   to   particle,   atom   to   mass,   the   min  utest   part   to   the   stupendous   whole  each   to   each,   each   to   all,  and   all   to   each  in   the   mysterious   bonds   of   a   ceaseless,   recipro  cal   influence.   An   influence   whose   workings   are   shown   to   be  alike   present   in   the   globular   dew-drop,   or   oblate-spheroidal   earth   ;  in   the   falling   shower,   or   vast   heaving   ocean   tides  ;   in   the   flying  thistle-down,   or   fixed,   ponderous   rock   ;   in   the   swinging   pendulum,  or   time-measuring   sun   ;   in   the   varying   and   unequal   moon,   or  earth's   slowly   retrograding   poles   ;   in   the   uncertain   meteor,   or  oiazing   comet   wheeling   swiftly   away   on   its   remote,   yet   determined  round.

And   yet   Newton,   amid   the   loveliness   and   magnitude   of   Om  nipotence,   lost   not   sight   of   the   Almighty   One.   A   secondary,  however   universal,   was   not   taken   for   the   First   Cause.   An   im  pressed   force,   however   diffused   and   powerful,   assumed   not   the  functions   of   the   creating,   giving   Energy.   Material   beauties,  splendours,   and   sublimities,   however   rich   in   glory,   and   endless   in  extent,   concealed   not   the   attributes   of   an   intelligent   Supreme.  From   the   depths   of   his   own   soul,   through   reason   and   the   WORD,  he   had   risen,   a   priori,   to   God   :   from   the   heights   of   Omnipotence,  through   the   design   and   law   of   the   builded   universe,   he   proved   </  posteriori,   a   Deity.   "   I   had,"   says   he,   "   an   eye   upon   such   prin  ciples   as   might   work,   with   considering   men,   for   the   belief   of   a  Deity,"   in   writing   the   PRINCIPIA   ;   at   the   conclusion   whereof,   he  teaches   that  "   this   most   beautiful   system   of   the   sun,   planets   and  comets,   could   only   proceed   from   the   counsel   and   dominion   of   an  intelligent   and   powerful   Being.   And   if   the   fixed   stars   are   the  centres   of   other   like   systems,   these,   being   forme   1   by   the   like  wise   counsels,   must   be   all   subject   to   the   dominion   of   One  ;   especially  since   the   light   of   the   fixed   stars   is   of   the   same   nature   with   the  light   of   the   sun,   and   from   every   system   light   passes   into   all   other  systems   :   and   lest   the   systems   of   the   fixed   stars   should,   by   their  gravity,   fall   on   each   other   mutually,   he   hath   placed   those   systems  at   immense   distances   one   from   another.  "   This   Being   governs   all   things,   not   as   the   soul   of   the   world,  but   as   Lord   over   all  ;   and   on   account   of   his   dominion   he   is   wont,  to   be   called   Lord   God   Travrowparwp   or   Universal   Ruler  ;   for   God  is   a   relative   word,   and   has   a   respect   to   servants   ;   and   Deity   is  the   dominion   of   God,   not   over   his   own   body,   as   those   imagine  who   fancy   God   to   be   the   soul   of   the   world,   but   over   servants.  The   Supreme   God   is   a   Being   eternal,   infinite,   absolutely   perfect  ;  but   a   being,   however   perfect,   without   dominion,   cannot   be   said   to

36   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  be   Lord   God  ;   for   we   say,   my   God,   your   God,   the   God   of   Israel  the   God   of   Gods,   and   Lord   of   Lords   ;   but   we   do   not   say,   my  Eternal,   your   Eternal,   the   Eternal   of   Israel,   the   Eternal   of   Gods   :  we   do   not   say   my   Infinite,   or   my   Perfect  :   these   are   titles   which  have   no   respect   to   servants.   The   word   God   usually   signifies  Lord   ;   but   every   Lord   is   not   God.   It   is   the   dominion   of   a   spir  itual   Being   which   constitutes   a   God   ;   a   true,   supreme,   or   imagi  nary   dominion   makes   a   true,   supreme,   or   imaginary   God.   And  from   his   true   dominion   it   follows   that   the   true   God   is   a   living,  intelligent   and   powerful   Being  ;   and   from   his   other   perfections,  that   he   is   supreme   or   most   perfect.   He   is   eternal   and   in  finite,   omnipotent   and   omniscient  ;   that   is,   his   duration   reaches  from   eternity   to   eternity   ;   his   presence   from   infinity   to   infinity  ;  he   governs   all   things   and   knows   all   things,   that   are   or   can   be  done.   He   is   not   eternity   or   infinity,   but   eternal   and   infinite   ;  he   is   not   duration   and   space,   but   he   endures   and   is   present.  He   endures   forever   and   is   everywhere   present  ;   and   by   existing  always   and   everywhere,   he   constitutes   duration   and   space.   Since  every   particle   of   space   is   always,   and   every   indivisible   moment  of   duration   is   everywhere,   certainly   the   Maker   and   Lord   of   things  cannot   be   never   and   nowhere.   Every   soul   that   has   perception  is,   though   in   different   times   and   different   organs   of   sense   and   mo  tion,   still   the   same   indivisible   person.   There   are   given   succes  sive   parts   in   duration,   co-existent   parts   in   space,   but   neither   the  one   nor   the   other   in   the   person   of   a   man,   or   his   thinking  principle  ;   and   much   less   can   they   be   found   in   the   thinking   sub  stance   of   God.   Every   man.   so   far   as   he   is   a   thing   that   has   j:er-  ceptiori,   is   one   and   the   same   man   during   his   whole   life,   in   all   and  each   of   his   organs   of   sense.   God   is   one   and   the   same   God,   al  ways   and   everywhere.   He   is   omnipresent,   not   virtually   only,  but   also   substantially  ;   for   virtue   cannot   subsist   without   sub  stance.   In   him   are   all   things   contained   and   moved  ;   yet   neither  affects   the   other   ;   God   suffers   nothing   from   the   motion   of   bodies   ;  bodies   find   no   resistance   from   the   omnipresence   of   God.   It   is  allowed   by   all   that   the   Supreme   God   exists   necessarily   ;   and   by  the   same   necessity   he   exists   always   and   everywhere.   Whence  also   he   is   all   similar,   all   eye,   all   ear,   all   brain,   all   arm,   all   powei

As   a   blind   man   has   no   idea   of   colours,   so   have   we  no   idea   of   the   manner   by   which   the   all-wise   God   perceives   and  understands   all   things.   He   is   utterly   void   of   all   body,   and   bodily  figure,   and   can   therefore   neither   be   seen,   nor   heard,   nor   touched   ;  nor   ought   he   to   be   worshipped   under   the   representation   of   any  corporeal   thing.   We   have   ideas   of   his   attributes,   but   what   the  real   substance   of   anything   is   we   know   not.   In   bodies   we   see  only   their   figures   and   colours,   we   hear   only   the   sounds,   we   touch  only   their   outward   surfaces,   we   smell   only   the   smells,   and   taste  only   the   savours   ;   but   their   inward   substances   are   not   to   be   known,  either   by   our   senses,   or   by   any   reflex   act   of   our   minds   :   much  less,   then,   have   we   any   idea   of   the   substance   of   God.   We   know  him   only   by   his   most   wise   and   excellent   contrivances   of   things,  and   final   causes   ;   we   admire   him   for   his   perfections   ;   but   we   rev  erence   and   adore   him   on   account   of   his   dominion  ;   for   we   adore  him   as   his   servants   ;   and   a   god   without   dominion,   providence,   and  final   causes,   is   nothing   else   but   Fate   and   Nature.

His   mode  of   procedure   in   these   experiments   was   simple   and   curious.   He  placed   a   double   convex   lens   of   a   large   known   radius   of   curvature,  the   flat   surface   of   a   plano-convex   object   glass.   Thus,   from

Letting   the   light   fall,   every   different   thickness   of   this  plate   of   air   gave   different   colours  the   point   of   contact   of   the  lens   and   glass   forming   the   centre   of   numerous   concentric   colored  nags.   Now   the   radius   of   curvature   of   the   lens   being   known,   the  thickness   of   the   plate   of   air,   at   any   given   point,   or   where   any   par  ticular   colour   appeared,   could   be   exactly   determined.   Carefully  noting,   therefore,   the   order   in   which   the   different   colours   ap  peared,   he   measured,   with   the   nicest   accuracy,   the   different   thick*  nesses   at   which   the   most   luminous   parts   of   the   rings   were   pro  duced,   whether   the   medium   were   air,   water,   or   mica  all   these  substances   giving   the   same   colours   at   different   thicknesses  ;  the  ratio   of   which   he   also   ascertained.   From   the   phenomena   obser  ved   in   these   experiments,   Newton   deduced   his   Theory   of   Fits   of  EASY   REFLECTION   AND   TRANSMISSION   of   light.   It   consists   in   suppos  ing   that   every   particle   of   light,   from   its   first   discharge   from   a   lumi  nous   body,   possesses,   at   equally   distant   intervals,   dispositions   to  be   reflected   from,   or   transmitted   through   the   surfaces   of   bodies  upon   which   it   may   fall.   For   instance,   if   the   rays   are   in   a   Fit   of  Easy   Reflection,   they   are   on   reaching   the   surface,   repelled,  thrown   off]   or   reflected   from   it  ;   if,   in   a   Fit   of   Easy   Transmission,  they   are   attracted,   drawn   in,   or   transmitted   through   it.   By   this  Theory   of   Fits,   our   author   likewise   explained   the   colours   of  thick   plates.  He   regarded   light   as   consisting   of   small   material   particles  emitted   from   shining   substances.   He   thought   that   these   parti  cles   could   be   re-combined   into   solid   matter,   so   that   "   gross   bodies  and   light,   were   convertible   into   one   another   ;"   that   the   particles   of  light   and   the   particles   of   solid   bodies   acted   mutually   upon   each  other  ;   those   of   light   agitating   and   heating   those   of   solid   bodies,  and   the   latter   attracting   and   repelling   the   former.   Newton   was  the   first   to   suggest   the   idea   of   the   POLARIZATION   of   light.  In   the   paper   entitled   An   Hypothesis   Explaining   Properties   of  Light,   December,   1675,   our   author   first   introduced   his   opinions   re  specting   Ether  opinions   which   he   afterward   abandoned   and   again

It   is   electric,  and   almost,   if   not   quite   immeasurably   elastic   and   rare.   "   By   the  force   and   action   of   which   spirit   the   particles   of   bodies   mutually  attract   one   another,   at   near   distances,   and   cohere,   if   contiguous   ;  and   electric   bodies   operate   at   greater   distances,   as   well   repelling  as   attracting   the   neighbouring   corpuscles   ;   and   light   is   emitted,  -reflected,   refracted,   inflected   and   heats   bodies   ;   and   all   sensation  is   excited,   and   the   members   of   animal   bodies   move   at   the   com  mand   of   the   will,   namely,   by   the   vibrations   of   this   spirit,   mutu  ally   propagated   along   the   solid   filaments   of   the   nerves,   from   the  outward   organs   of   sense   to   the   brain,   and   from   the   brain   into   the  muscles."   This   "   spirit"   was   no   anima   mundi   ;   nothing   further  from   the   thought   of   Newton   ;   but   was   it   not,   on   his   part,   a   par  tial   recognition   of,   or   attempt   to   reach   an   ultimate   material   force,  or   primary   element,   by   means   of   which,   "   in   the   roaring   loom   of  time,"   this   material   universe,   God's   visible   garment,   may   be  woven   for   us   ?  The   Royal   Society   were   greatly   interested   in   the   results   of  some   experiments,   which   our   author   had,   at   the   same   time,   com  municated   to   them   relative   to   the   excitation   of   electricity   in   glass   ;  and   they,   after   several   attempts   and   further   direction   from   him,  succeeded   in   re-producing   the   same   phenomena.  One   of   the   most   curious   of   Newton's   minor   inquiries   related   to  the   connexion   between   the   refractive   powers   and   chemical   com  position   of   bodies.   He   found   on   comparing   the   refractive   powers  and   the   densities   of   many   different   substances,   that   the   former  were   very   nearly   proportional   to   the   latter,   in   the   same   bodies.  Unctuous   and   sulphureous   bodies   were   noticed   as   remarkable   excep  tions  as   well   as   the   diamond  their   refractive   powers   being   two  or   three   times   greater   in   respect   of   their   densities   than   in   the  case   of   other   substances,   while,   as   among   themselves,   the   one   was  generally   proportional   to   the   other.   He   hence   inferred   as   to   the  diamond   a   great   degree   of   combustibility    ";  a   conjecture   which  the   experiments   of   modern   chemistry   have   shown   to   be   true.  The   chemical   researches   of   our   author   were   probably   pursued  with   more   or   less   diligence   from   the   time   of   his   witnessing   some

DE   NATURA   ACIDORUM   is   a   short   chemical   paper,   on  various    topics,    and   published    in   Dr.    Horsley's   Edition   of   his  works.      TABULA   QUANTITATUM   E   r   GRADUUM   COLORIS   was   in  serted   iii   the   Philosophical   Transactions   ;   it   contains   a   compara  tive   scale   of   temperature   from   that   of   melting   ice   to   that   of   a  small   kitchen   coal-fire.      He   regarded   fire   as   a   body   heated   so   hot  as   to   emit   light   copiously  ;   and   flame   as   a   vapour,   fume,   or   ex  halation   heated    so   hot   as   to   shine.      To   elective   attraction,   by  the   operation   of   which   the   small   particles   of   bodies,   as   he   con  ceived,   act   upon   one   another,   at   distances   so   minute   as   to   escape  observation,   he   ascribed   all   the    various    chemical   phenomena   ot  precipitation,   combination,   solution,   and    crystallization,    and    the  mechanical   phenomena   of   cohesion   and   capillary   attraction.     New  ton's   chemical   views   were    illustrated   and   confirmed,   in   part,   at  least,   in   his   own   life-time.      As   to   the   structure   of   bodies,   he   was  of   opinion   "   that   the   smallest   particles   of   matter    may   cohere   by  the   strongest   attractions,   and   compose   bigger   particles   of   weaker  virtue   ;   and   many   of   these   may   cohere   and   compose   bigger   par  tides   whose   virtue   is   still   weaker  ;   and   so   on   for   divers   succes  sions,   until   the   progression   end   in   the   biggest   particles,   on   which  the   operations   in   chemistry   and   the   colours   of   natural   bodies   de  pend,   and   which   by   adhering,   compose   bodies   of   sensible   magni  tude."  There   is   good   reason   to   suppose   that   our   author   was   a   diligent  student   of   the   writings   of   Jacob   Behmen   ;   and   that   in   conjunction  with   a   relative,   Dr.   Newton,   he   was   busily   engaged,   for   several  months   in   the   earlier   part   of   life,   in   quest   of   the   philosopher's  tincture.   "   Great   Alchymist,"   however,   very   imperfectly   de  scribes   the   character   of   Behmen,   whose   researches   into   things  material   and   things   spiritual,   things   human   and   things   divine,   ai-  ford   the   strongest   evidence   of   a   great   and   original   mind.

2S   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  his   reply,   dated   June   30th,   16(Jl,   narrates   the   following   circum  stances,   which   probably   took   place   in   the   course   of   his   optical  researches.   Thus  :  "   The   observation   you   mention   in   Mr.   Boyle's   Book   of   Colours  I   once   tried   upon   myself   with   the   hazard   of   my   eyes.   The  manner   was   this  ;   I   looked   a   very   little   while   upon   the   sun   in   the  looking-glass   with   my   right   eye,   and   then   turned   my   eyes   into   a  dark   corner   of   my   chamber,   arid   winked,   to   observe   the   impres  sion   made,   and   the   circles   of   colours   which   encompassed   it,   and  how   they   decayed   by   degrees,   and   at   last   vanished.   This   I   re  peated   a   second   and   a   third   time.   At   the   third   time,   when   the  phantasm   of   light   and   colours   about   it   were   almost   vanished,   in  tending   my   fancy   upon   them   to   see   their   last   appearance,   I   found,  to   my   amazement,   that   they   began   to   return,   and   by   little   and  little   to   become   as   lively   and   vivid   as   when   I   had   newly   looked  upon   the   sun.   But   when   I   ceased   to   intend   my   fancy   upon   them,  they   vanished   again.   After   this,   I   found,   that   as   often   as   I   went  into   the   dark,   and   intended   my   mind   upon   them,   as   when   a   man  looks   earnestly   to   see   anything   which   is   difficult   to   be   seen,   I  could   make   the   phantasm   return   without   looking   any   more   upon  the   sun  ;   and   the   oftener   I   made   it   return,   the   more   easily   I   could  make   it   return   again.   And,   at   length,   by   repeating   this,   without  looking   any   more   upon   the   sun,   I   made   such   an   impression   on   my  eye,   that,   if   I   looked   upon   the   clouds,   or   a   book,   or   any   bright  object,   I   saw   upon   it   a   round   bright   spot   of   light   like   the   sun,  and,   which   is   still   stranger,   though   I   looked   upon   the   sun   with  my   right   eye   only,   and   not   with   my   left,   yet   my   fancy   began   *o  make   an   impression   upon   my   left   eye,   as   well   us   upon   my   right.  For   if   I   shut   my   right   eye,   or   looked   upon   a   book,   or   the   clouds,  with   my   left   eye,   I   could   see   the   spectrum   of   the   sun   almost   as  plain   as   with   my   right   eye,   if   I   did   but   intend   my   fancy   a   little  while   upon   it  ;   for   at   first,   if   I   shut   my   right   eye,   and   looked   with  my   left,   the   spectrum   of   the   sun   did   not   appear   till   I   intended   my  fancy   upon   it  ;   but   by   repeating,   this   appeared   every   time   more  easily.   And   now,   in   a   few   hours'   time,   I   had   brought   my   eyes  to   such   a   pass,   that   I   could   look   upon   no   blight   object   with   either  eye,   but   I   saw   the   sun   before   me,   so   that   I   durst   neither   write

For   if   I   thought  upon   him,   I   presently   saw   his   picture,   though   I   was   in   the   dark.  But   by   keeping   in   the   dark,   and   employing   my   mind   about   other  things,   I   began   in   three   or   four   days   to   have   some   use   of   my   eyes  again  ;   and   by   forbearing   to   look   upon   bright   objects,   recovered  them   pretty   well,   though   not   so   well   but   that,   for   some   months  after,   the   spectrum   of   the   sun   began   to   return   as   often   as   I   began  to   meditate   upon   the   phenomena,   even   though   I   lay   in   bed   at   mid  night   with   my   curtains   drawn.   But   now   I   have   been   very   well  for   many   years,   though   I   am   apt   to   think,   if   I   durst   venture   my  eyes,   I   could   still   make   the   phantasm   return   by   the   power   of   my  fancy.   This   story   I   tell   you,   to   let   you   understand,   thaj;   in   the  observation   related   by   Mr.   Boyle,   the   man's   fancy   probably   con  curred   with   the   impression   made   by   the   sun's   light   to   produce  that   phantasm   of   the   sun   which   he   constantly   saw   in   bright   ob  jects.   And   so   your   question   about   the   cause   of   phantasm   in  volves   another   about   the   power   of   fancy,   which   I   must   confess   is  too   hard   a   knot   for   me   to   untie.   To   place   this   effect   in   a   constant  motion   is   hard,   because   the   sun   ought   then   to   appear   perpetually.  It   seems   rather   to   consist   in   a   disposition   of   the   sensorium   to  move   the   imagination   strongly,   and   to   be   easily   moved,   both   by  the   imagination   and   by   the   light,   as   often   as   bright   objects   are  looked   upon."J  Though   Newton   had   continued   silent,   yet   his   thoughts   were  by   no   means   inactive   upon   the   vast   subject   of   the   planetary   mo  tions.   The   idea   of   Universal   Gravitation,   first   caught   sight   of,   so  to   speak,   in   the   garden   at   Woolsthorpe,   years   ago,   had   gradually  expanded   upon   him.   We   find   him,   in   a   letter   to   Dr.   Hooke,  Secretary   of   the   Royal   Society,   dated   in   November,   1679,   pro  posing   to   verify   the   motion   of   the   earth   by   direct   experiment,  namely,   by   the   observation   of   the   path   pursued   by   a   body   falling  from   a   considerable   height.   He   had   concluded   that   the   path  would   be   spiral  ;   but   Dr.   Hooke   maintained   that   it   would   be   an  eccentric   ellipse   iu   vacuo,   and   an   ellipti-spiral   in   a   resisting   me  dium.   Our   author,   aided   by   this   correction   of   his   error,   and   by

When   he   was   attending   a   meeting   of   the   Royal   Society,   in  June   1682,   the   conversation   fell   upon   the   subject   of   the   measure  ment   of   a   degree   of   the   meridian,   executed   by   M.   Picard,   a  French   Astronomer,   in   1679.   Newton   took   a   memorandum   oi  the   result  ;   and   afterward,   at   the   earliest   opportunity,   computed  from   it   the   diameter   of   the   earth   :   furnished   with   these   new   data,  he   resumed   his   calculation   of   1666.   As   he   proceeded   therein,  he   saw   that   his   early   expectations   were   now   likely   to   be   realized   ;  the   thick   rushing,   stupendous   results   overpowered   him  ;   he   be  came   unable   to   carry   on   the   process   of   calculation,   and   intrusted  its   completion   to   one   of   his   friends.   The   discoverer   had,   indeed,  grasped   the   master-fact.   The   law   of   falling   bodies   at   the   earth's  surface   was   at   length   identified   with   that   which   guided   the   moon  in   her   orbit.   And   so   his   GREAT   THOUGHT,   that   had   for   sixteen  years   loomed   up   in   dim,   gigantic   outline,   amid   the   first   dawn   of   a  plausible   hypothesis,   now   stood   forth,   radiant   and   not   less   grand,  in   the   mid-day   light   of   demonstrated   truth.  It   were   difficult,   nay   impossible   to   imagine,   even,   the   influence  of   a   result   like   this   upon   a   mind   like   Newton's.   It   was   as   if   the  keystone   had   been   fitted   to   the   glorious   arch   by   which   his   spirit  should   ascend   to   the   outskirts   of   infinite   space  spanning   the   immea  surable  weighing   the   imponderable  computing   the   incalculable   mapping   out   the   marchings   of   the   planets,   and   the   far-wander  ings   of   the   comefs,   and   catching,   bring   back   to   earth   some   clearer  notes   of   that   higher   melody   which,   as   a   sounding   voice,   bears  perpetual   witness   to   the   design   and   omnipotence   of   a   creating  Deity.  Newton,   extending   the   law   thus   obtained,   composed   a   series  of   about   twelve   propositions   on   the   motion   of   the   primary   planets

At   or   near   this   pe  riod,   other   philosophers,   as   Sir   Christopher   Wren,   Dr.   Halley,  and   Dr.   Hooke,   were   engaged   in   investigating   the   same   subject  ;  but   with   no   definite   or   satisfactory   results.   Dr.   Halley,   having  seen,   it   is   presumed,   our   author's   propositions,   went   in   August,  1684,   to   Cambridge   to   consult   with   him   upon   the   subject.  Newton   assured   him

 gave   an   account   of   it,   in   a   letter   to   a   friend,   dated   February   23d,  1668-9  a   letter   which   is   also   remarkable   for   containing   the   firs'  allusion   to   his   discoveries   "   concerning   the   nature   of   light."   En  couraged   by   the   success   of   his   first   experiment,   he   again   executed  with   his   own   hands,   not   long   afterward,   a   second   and   superior  instrument   of   the   same   kind.   The   existence   of   this   having   come  to   the   knowledge   of   the   Royal   Society   of   London,   in   1671,   they  requested   it   of   Newton   for   examination.   He   accordingly   sent   it  to   them,   It   excited   great   admiration;   it   was   shown   to   the   king*  a   drawing   and   description   of   it   was   sent   to   Paris  ;   and   the   tele-  scope   itself   was   carefully   preserved   in   the   Library   of   the   Society.  Newton   lived   to   see   his   invention   in   public   use,   and   of   eminent  service   in   the   cause   of   science.  In   the   spring   of   1669,   he   wrote   to   his   friend   Francis   Aston,  Esq.,   then   about   setting   out   on   his   travels,   a   letter   of   advice   and  directions,   it   was   dated   May   18th,   and   is   interesting   as   exhibit  ing   some   of   the   prominent   features   in   Newton's   character.  Thus   :  "   Since   in   your   letter   you   give   me   so   much   liberty   of   spending  my   judgment   about   what   may   be   to   your   advantage   in   travelling,  1   shall   do   it   more   freely   than   perhaps   otherwise   would   have   been  decent,   Fir,ct,   then,   I   will   lay   down   some   general   rules,   most   of

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   19  which,   I   bolieA   e,   you   have   considered   already  ;   but   if   any   of  them   be   new   to   you,   they   may   excuse   the   rest   ;   if   none   at   all,  yet   is   my   punishment   more   in   writing   than   yours   in   reading.  "When   you   come   into   any   fresh   company.   1.   Observe   their  humours.   2.   Suit   your   own   carriage   thereto,   by   which   insinua  tion   you   will   make   their   converse   more   free   and   open.   3.   Let  your   discourse   be   more   in   queries   and   doubtings   than   peremptory  assertions   or   disputings,   it   being   the   design   of   travellers   to   learn,  not   to   teach.   Besides,   it   will   persuade   your   acquaintance   that  you   have   the   greater   esteem   of   them,   and   so   make   them   more  ready   to   communicate   what   they   know   to   you   ;   whereas   nothing  sooner   occasions   disrespect   and   quarrels   than   peremptoriness.  You   will   find   little   or   no   advantage   in   seeming   wiser   or   much  more   ignorant   than   your   company.   4.   Seldom   discommend   any  thing   though   never   so   bad,   or   do   it   but   moderately,   lest   you   be  unexpectedly   forced   to   an   unhandsome   retraction.   It   is   safer   to  commend   any   thing   more   than   it   deserves,   than   to   discommend  a   thing   so   much   as   it   deserves;   for   commendations   meet   not  so   often   with   oppositions,   or,   at   least,   are   not   usually   so   ill   re  sented   by   men   that   think   otherwise,   as   discommendations  ;   and  you   will   insinuate   into   men's   favour   by   nothing   sooner   than   seem  ing   to   approve   and   commend   what   they   like   ;   but   beware   o  doing   it   by   comparison.   5.   If   you   be   affronted,   it   is   better,   in   c  foreign   country,   to   pass   it   by   in   silence,   and   with   a   jest,   though  with   some   dishonour,   than   to   endeavour   revenge  ;   for,   in   the   first  case,   your   credit's   ne'er   the   worse   when   you   return   into   England,  or   come   into   other   company   that   have   not   heard   of   the   quarrel.  But,   in   the   second   case,   you   may   bear   the   marks   of   the   quarrel  while   you   live,   if   you   outlive   it   at   all.   But,   if   you   find   yoursell  unavoidably   engaged,   'tis   best,   I   think,   if   you   can   command   your  passion   and   language,   to   keep   them   pretty   evenly   at   some   certain  moderate   pitch,   not   much   heightening   them   to   exasperate   your  adversary,   or   provoke   his   friends,   nor   letting   them   grow   overmuch  dejected   to   make   him   insult.   In   a   word,   if   you   can   keep   reason  above   passion,   that   and   watchfulness   will   be   your   best   defendants.  To   which   purpose   you   may   consider,   that,   though   such   excuses  is   this  He   provok't   me   so   much   I   could   not   forbear  may   pass

"   To   these   I   may   add   some   general   heads   for   inquiries   or   ob  servations,   such   as   at   present   I   can   think   on.   As,   1.   To   observe  the   policies,   wealth,   and   state   affairs   of   nations,   so   far   as   a   soli-  fary   traveller   may   conveniently   do.   2.   Their   impositions   upon  all   sorts   of   people,   trades,   or   commodities,   that   are   remarkable.  3.   Their   laws   and   customs,   how   far   they   differ   from   ours.   4.  Their   trades   and   arts   wherein   they   excel   or   come   short   of   us   in  England.   5.   Such   fortifications   as   you   shall   meet   with,   their  fashion,   strength,   and   advantages   for   defence,   and   other   such   mili  tary   affairs   as   are   considerable.   6.   The   power   and   respect   be  longing   to   their   degrees   of   nobility   or   magistracy.   7.   It   will   not  be   time   misspent   to   make   a   catalogue   of   the   names   and   excellen  cies   of   those   men   that   are   most   wise,   learned,   or   esteemed   in   any  nation.   8.   Observe   the   mechanism   and   manner   of   guiding   ships.  9.   Observe   the   products   of   Nature   in   several   places,   especially   in  mines,   with   the   circumstances   of   mining   and   of   extracting   metals  or   minerals    out   of   their   ore,   and   of   refining   them   ;   and   if   you  meet   with    any   transmutations    out     of   their   own     species     into  another   (as   out   of   iron   into   copper,   out   of   any   metal   into   quick  silver,   out   of   one   salt   into   another,   or   into   an   insipid   body,   &c.),  those,   above   all,   will   be   worth   your   noting,   being   the   most   lucif-  erous,   and   many   times   lucriferous   experiments,   too,   in   philosophy.  10.   The    prices    of   diet    and   other   things.       11.   And   the   staple  commodities   of   places.  "   These   generals   (such   as   at   present   I   could   think   of),   if   they  will   serve   for   nothing   else,   yet   they   may   assist   you   in   drawing   up  a   model   to   regulate   your   travels   by.   '   As   for   particulars,   these   that  follow   are   all   that   1   can   now   think   of,   viz.  ;   whether   at   Schem-  nitium,   in   Hungary   (where   there   are   mines   of   gold,   copper,   iron,  vitriol,   antimony,   &c.).   they   change   iron   into   copper   by   dissolving  in   a   vitriolate   water,   which   they   find   in   cavities   of   rocks   in   the  mines,   and   then   melting   the   slimy   solution   in   a   stroi   ig   fire,   which  in   the   cooling   proves   copper.   The   like   is   said   to   be   done   in   other  places,   which   I   cannot   now   remember  ;   perhaps,   too,   it   may   be  lone   in   Italy.   For   about   twenty   or   thirty   years   agone   there   was
--- Page 29 ---
LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON,   21  a   certain   vitriol   came   from   thence   (called   Roman   vitriol),   but   of  a   nobler   virtue   than   that   which   is   now   called   by   that   name   ;  which   vitriol   is   not   now   to   be   gotten,   because,   perhaps,   they   make  a   greater   gain   by   some   such   trick   as   turning   iron   into   copper  with   it   than   by   selling   it.   2.   Whether,   in   Hungary,   Sclavonia,  Bohemia,   near   the   town   Eila,   or   at   the   mountains   of   Bohemia  near   Silesia,   there   be   rivers   whose   waters   are   impregnated   with  gold   ;   perhaps,   the   gold   being   dissolved   by   some   corrosive   water  like   aqua   regis,   and   the   solution   carried   along   with   the   stream,  that   runs   through   the   mines.   And   whether   the   practice   of   laying  mercury   in   the   rivers,   till   it   be   tinged   with   gold,   and   then   strain  ing   the   mercury   through   leather,   that   the   gold   may   stay   behind,  be   a   secret   yet,   or   openly   practised.   3.   There   is   newly   con  trived,   in   Holland,   a   mill   to   grind   glasses   plane   withal,   and   I  think   polishing   them   too   ;   perhaps   it   will   be   worth   the   while   to   see  it.      4.   There   is   in   Holland   one  Borry,   who   some   years   since  was   imprisoned   by   the   Pope,   to   have   extorted   from   him   secrets  (as   I   am   told)   of   great   worth,   both   as   to   medicine   and   profit,   but  he   escaped   into   Holland,   where   they   have   granted   him   a   guard.  I   think   he   usually   goes   clothed   in   green.   Pray   inquire   what   you  can   of   him,   and   whether   his   ingenuity   be   any   profit   to   the   Dutch.  You   may   inform   yourself   whether   the   Dutch   have   any   tricks   to  keep   their   ships   from   being   all   worm-eaten   in   their   voyages   to  the   Indies.   Whether   pendulum   clocks   do   any   service   in   finding  out   the   longitude,   &c.  "   I   am   very   weary,   and   shall   not   stay   to   part   with   a   long  compliment,   only   I   wish   you   a   good   journey,   and   God   be   with  you."  It   was   not   till   the   month   of   June,   1669,   that   our   author   made  known   his   Method   of   Fluxions.   He   then   communicated   the  work   which   he   had   composed   upon   the   subject,   and   entitled,  ANALYSIS   PER   EQUATIONES   NUMERO   TERMINORUM   INFINITAS,  to   his   friend   Dr.   Barrow.   The   latter,   in   a   letter   dated   20th   of   the  same   month,   mentioned   it   to   Mr.   Collins,   and   transmitted   it   to  him,   on   the   31st   of   July   thereafter.   Mr.   Collins   greatly   approv>  ed   of   the   work  ;   took   a   copy   of   it  ;   and   sent   the   original   back  to   Dr.   Barrow.   During   the   same   and   the   two   following   years,   Mr

<   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  Collins,   by   his   extensive   correspondence,   spread   the   knowledge  of   this   discovery   among   the   mathematicians   in   England,   Scotland,  France,   Holland   and   Italy.  Dr.   Barrow,   having   resolved   to   devote   himself   to   Theology,  resigned   the   Lucasian   Professorship   of   Mathematics,   in   1669,   in  favour   of   Newton,   who   accordingly   received   the   appointment   to  the   vacant   chair.  During   the   years   1669,   1670,   and   1671,   our   author,   as   such  Professor,   delivered   a   course   of   Optical   Lectures.   Though   these  contained   his   principal   discoveries   relative   to   the   different   re-  frangibility   of   light,   yet   the   discoveries   themselves   did   not   be  come   publicly   known,   it   seems,   till   he   communicated   them   to   the  Royal   Society,   a   few   weeks   after   being   elected   a   member   there  of,   in   the   spring   of   1671-2.   He   now   rose   rapidly   in   reputation,  and   was   soon   regarded   as   foremost   among   the   philosophers   of   the  age.   His   paper   on   light   excited   the   deepest   interest   in   the   Royal  Society,   who   manifested   an   anxious   solicitude   to   secure   the   author  from   the   "   arrogations   of   others,"   and   proposed   to   publish   his  discourse   in   the   monthly   numbers   in   which   the   Transactions   were  given   to   the   world.   Newton,   gratefully   sensible   of   these   expres  sions   of   esteem,   willingly   accepted   of   the   proposal   for   publication.  He   gave   them   also,   at   this   time,   the   results   of   some   further   ex  periments   in   the   decomposition   and   re-composition   of   light  :  that  the   same   degree   of   refrangibility   always   belonged   to   the   same  colour,   and   the   same   colour   to   the   same   degree   of   refrangibility  :  that   the   seven   different   colours   of   the   spectrum   were   original,   or  simple,   and   that   whiteness^   or   white   light   was   a   compound   of   all  these   seven   colours.  The   publication   of   his   new   doctrines   on   light   soon   called   forth  violent   opposition   as   to   their   soundness.   Hooke   and   Huygens  men   eminent   for   ability   and   learning  were   the   most   conspicuous  of   the   assailants.   And   though   Newton   effectually   silenced   all   his  adversaries,   yet   he   felt   the   triumph   of   little   gain   in   comparison  .vith   the   loss   his   tranquillity   had   sustained.   He   subsequently   re-  narked   in   allusion   to   this   controversy  and   to   one   with   whom  he   was   destined   to   have   a   longer   and   a   bitterer   conflict  "   I   was  so   persecuted   with   discussions   arising   from   the   publication   of   m   v

He   also   contemplated,   about   the   same   time,   an   edition   of   Kirick-  huysen's   Algebra,   with   notes   and   additions;   partially   arranging,  as   an   introduction   to   the   work,   a   treatise,   entitled,   A   Method   of  Fluxions  ;   but   he   finally   abandoned   the   design.   This   treatise,  however,   he   resolved,   or   rather   consented,   at   a   late   period   of   his  life,   to   put   forth   separately   ;   and   the   plan   would   probably   have  been   carried   into   execution   had   riot   his   death   intervened.   It   was  translated   into   English,   and   published   in   1736   by   John   Colson,  Professor   of   Mathematics   in   Cambridge.  Newton,   it   is   thought,   made   his   discoveries   concerning   the  INFLECTION   and   DIFFRACTION   of   light   before   1674.   The   phe  nomena   of   the   inflection   of   light   had   been   first   discovered   more  than   ten   years   before   by   Grimaldi.   And   Newton   began   by   re  peating   one   of   the   experiments   of   the   learned   Jesuit  admitting  a   beam   of   the   sun's   light   through   a   small   pin   hole   into   a   dark  chamber  :   the   light   diverged   from   the   aperture   in   the   form   of   a,  cone,   and   the   shadows   of   all   bodies   placed   in   this   light   were  larger   than   might   have   been   expected,   and   surrounded   with   three  coloured   fringes,   the   nearest   being   widest,   and   the   most   remote  the   narrowest.   Newton,   advancing   upon   this   experiment,   took  exact   measures   of   the   diameter   of   the   shadow   of   a   human   hair,  and   of   the   breadth   of   the   fringes,   at   different   distances   behind   it,  and   discovered   that   these   diameters   and   breadths   were   not   pro  portional   to   the   distances   at   which   they   were   measured.   He  hence   supposed   that   the   rays   which   passed   by   the   edge   of   the  hair   were   deflected   or   turned   aside   from   it,   as   if   by   a   repulsive  force,   the   nearest   rays   suffering   the   greatest,   the   more   remote   a  less   degree   of   deflection.   In   explanation   of   the   coloured   fringes,  he   queried   :   whether   the   rays   which   differ   in   refrangibility   do   not  differ   also   in   flexibility,   and   whether   they   are   by   these   dif  ferent   inflections,   separated   from   one   another,   so   as   after   separa-

Also,   whether   the   rays,   in   passing   by   the   edges   and   sides   ol  bodies,   are   not   bent   several   times   backwards   and   forwards   with  an   eel-like   motion  the   three   fringes   arising   from   three   such  bendings   ?   His   inquiries   on   this   subject   were   here   interrupted  and   fiever   renewed.  His   Theory   of   the   COLOURS   of   NATURAL   BODIES   was   commu  nicated   to   the   Royal   Society,   in   February,   1675.   This   is   justly  regarded   as   one   of   the   profoundest   of   his   speculations.   The   fun  damental   principles   of   the   Theory   in   brief,   are  :  That   bodies  possessing   the   greatest   refractive   powers   reflect   the   greatest  quantity   of   light  ;   and   that,   at   the   confines   of   equally   refracting  media,   there   is   no   reflection.   That   the   minutest   particles   of   al  most   all   natural   bodies   are   in   some   degree   transparent.   That  between   the   particles   of   bodies   there   are   pores,   or   spaces,   either  empty   or   filled   with   media   of   a   less   density   than   the   particles  themselves.   That   these   particles,   and   pores   or   spaces,   have   some  definite   size.   Hence   he   deduced   the   Transparency,   Opacity,   and  colours   of   natural   bodies.   Transparency   arises   from   the   particles  and   their   pores   being   too   small   to   cause   reflection   at   their   com  mon   surfaces  the   light   all   passing   through   ;   Opacity   from   the  opposite   cause   of   the   particles   and   their   pores   being   sufficiently  large   to   reflect   the   light   which   is   "   stopped   or   stifled7'   by   the  multitude   of   reflections  ;   and   colours   from   the   particles,   accord  ing   to   their   several   sizes,   reflecting   rays   of   one   colour   and   trans  mitting   those   of   another  or   in   other   words,   the   colour   that  meets   the   eye   is   the   colour   reflected,   while   all   the   other   rays   are  transmitted   or   absorbed.  Analogous   in   origin   to   the   colours   of   natural   bodies,   he   con  sidered   the   COLOURS   OF   THIN   PLATES.   This   subject   was   interest  ing   and   important,   and   had   attracted   considerable   investigation.  He,   however,   was   the   first   to   determi

Newton   had   an   early   and   decided   taste   for   drawing.   Pictures,  taken   sometimes   from   copies,   but   often   from   life,   and   drawn,  coloured   and   framed   by   himself,   ornamented   his   apartment.   He  was   skilled   also,   in   poetical   composition,   "   excelled   in   making  verses   ;"   some   of   these   were   borne   in   remembrance   and   repeated,  seventy   years   afterward,   by   Mrs.   Vincent,   for   whom,   in   early  youth,   as   Miss   Storey,   he   formed   an   ardent   attachment.   She  was   the   sister   of   a   physician   resident   near   Woolsthorpe  ;   but  Newton's   intimate   acquaintance   with   her   began   at   Grantham.  where   they   were   both   numbered   among   the   inmates   of   the   same  house.   Two   or   three   years   younger   than   himself,   of   great   per  sonal   beauty,   and   unusual   talent,   her   society   afforded   him   the  greatest   pleasure   ;   and   their   youthful   friendship,   it   is   believed,  gradually   rose   to   a   higher   passion  ;   but   inadequacy   of   fortune  prevented   their   union.   Miss   Storey   was   afterwards   twice   mar  ried   ;   Newton,   never;   his   esteem   for   her   continued   unabated  during   life,   accompanied   by   numerous   acts   of   attention   and  kindness.  In   1656,   Newton's   mother   was   again   left   a   widowr,   and   took  up   her   abode   once   more   at   Woolsthorpe.   He   was   now   fifteen  years   of   age,   and   had   made   great   progress   in   his   studies   ;   but   she,  desirous   of   his   help,   and   from   motives   of   economy,   recalled   him  from   school.   Business   occupations,   however,   and   the   manage  ment   of   the   farm,   proved   utterly   distasteful   to   him.   When   sent   to  Grantham   Market   on   Saturdays,   he   would   betake   himself   to   his  former   lodgings   in   the   apothecary's   garret,   where   some   of   Mr.  Clark's   old   books   employed   his   thoughts   till   the   aged   and   trust  worthy   servant   had   executed   the   family   commissions   and   announced  the   necessity   of   return   :   or,   at   other   times,   our   young   philosopher  would   seat   himself   under   a   hedge,   by   the   wayside,   and   continue  his   studies   till   the   same   faithful   personage  proceeding   alone   to  the   town   and   completing   the   day's   business  stopped   as   he   re-

In   fact,   his   passion   for   study   grew   daily   more  absorbing,   and   his   dislike   for   every   other   occupation   more   in  tense.   His   mother,   therefore,   wisely   resolved   to   give   him   all   the  advantages   which   an   education   could   confer.   He   was   sent   back  to   Grantham   school,   where   he   remained   for   some   months   in   busy  preparation   for   his   academical   studies.   At   the   recommendation  of   one   of   his   uncles,   who   had   himself   studied   at   Trinity   College,  Cambridge,   Newton   proceeded   thither,   and   was   duly   admitted.  on   the   5th   day   of   June   1660,   in   the   eighteenth   year   of   his   age.  The   eager   student   had   now   entered   upon   a   new   and   wider  field  ;   and   we   find   him   devoting   himself   to   the   pursuit   of   know  ledge   with   amazing   ardour   and   perseverance.   Among   other   sub  jects,   his   attention   was   soon   drawn   to   that   of   Judicial   Astrology  He   exposed   the   folly   of   this   pseudo-science   by   erecting   a   figure  with   the   aid   of   one   or   two   of   the   problems   of   Euclid   ;  and   thus  began   his   study   of   the   Mathematics.   His   researches   into   this  science   were   prosecuted   with   unparallelled   vigour   and   success.  Regarding   the   propositions   contained   in   Euclid   as   self-evident  truths,   he   passed   rapidly   over   this   ancient   system  a   step   which  he   afterward   much   regretted  and   mastered,   without   further   pre  paratory   study,   the   Analytical   Geometry   of   Descartes.   Wallis's  Arithmetic   of   Infinites,   Saunderson's   Logic,   and   the   Optics   of  Kepler,   he   also   studied   with   great   care   ;   writing   upon   them  many   comments  ;   and,   in   these   notes   on   Wallis's   work   was   un  doubtedly   the   germ   of   his   fluxionary   calculus.   His   progress   was  so   great   that   he   found   himself   more   profoundly   versed   than   his   tutor  in   many   branches   of   learning.   Yet   his   acquisitions   were   not  gotten   with   the   rapidity   of   intuition  ;   but   they   were   thoroughly  made   and   firmly   secured.   Quickness   of   apprehension,   or   Intel  lectual   nimbleness   did   not   belong   to   him.   He   saw   too   far   :   his,  insight   was   too   deep.   He   dwelt   fully,   cautiously   upon   the   least  subject  ;   while   to   the   consideration   of   the   greatest,   he   brought   a  massive   strength   joined   with   a   matchless   clearness,   that,   regard  less   of   the   merely   trivial   or   unimportant,   bore   with   unerring   sa  gacity   upon   the   prominences   of   the   subject,   and,   grappling   with  its   difficulties,   rarely   failed   to   surmount   them.

In   the   year   1665,   he   received   the   degree   of   Bachelor   of   Arts  ;  and,   in   1666,   he   entered   upon   those   brilliant   and   imposing   dis  coveries   which   have   conferred   inappreciable   benefits   upon   science,  and   immortality   upon   his   own   name.  Newton,   himself,   states   that   he   was   in   possession   of   his   Method  of   Fluxions,   "   in   the   year   1666,   or   before."   Infinite   quantities  had   long   been   a   subject   of   profound   investigation  ;   among   the  ancients   by   Archimedes,   and   Pappus   of   Alexandria  ;   among   the  moderns   by   Kepler,   Cavaleri,   Roberval,   Fermat   and   Wallis.  With   consummate   ability   Dr.   Wallis   had   improved   upon   the   la-  hours   of   his   predecessors  :   with   a   higher   power,   Newton   moved  forwards   from   where   Wallis   stopped.   Our   author   first   invented  his   celebrated   BINOMIAL   THEOREM.   And   then,   applying   this  Theorem   to   the   rectification   of   curves,   and   to   the   determination  of   the   surfaces   and   contents   of   solids,   and   the   position   of   their  centres   of   gravity,   he   discovered   the   general   principle   of   deducing  the   areas   of   curves   from   the   ordinate,   by   considering   the   area   as  a   nascent   quantity,   increasing   by   continual   fluxion   in   the   propor  tion   of   the   length   of   the   ordinate,   and   supposing   the   abscissa  to   increase   uniformly   in   proportion   to   the   time.   Regarding   lines  as   generated   by   the   motion   of   points,   surfaces   by   the   motion   of  lines,   and   solids   by   the   motion   of   surfaces,   and   considering   that  the   ordinates,   abscissae,   &c.,   of   curves   thus   formed,   vary   accord  ing   to   a   regular   law   depending   on   the   equation   of   the   curve,  he   deduced   from   this   equation   the   velocities   with   which   these  quantities   are   generated,   and   obtained   by   the   rules   of   infinite  series,   the   ultimate   value   required.   To   the   velocities   with   which  every   line   or   quantity   is   generated,   he   gave   the   name   of   FLUX  IONS,   and   to   the   lines   or   quantities   themselves,   that   of   FLUENTS.

At   this   period,   the   most   distinguished   philosophers   were   direct  ing   all   their   energies   to   the   subject   of   light   and   the   improvement  of   the   refracting   telescope.   Newton,   having   applied   himself   to  the   grinding   of   "optic   glasses   of   other   figures   than   spherical,"   ex  perienced   the   impracticability   of   executing   such   lenses   ;   and   con  jectured   that   their   defects,   and   consequently   those   of   refracting  telescopes,   might   arise   from   some   other   cause   than   the   imperfect  convergency   of   rays   to   a   single   point.   He   accordingly   "procured  a   triangular   glass   prism   to   try   therewith   the   celebrated   phenom  ena   of   colours."   His   experiments,   entered   upon   with   zeal,   and  conducted   with   that   industry,   accuracy,   and   patient   thought,   for  which   he   was   so   remarkable,   resulted   in   the   grand   conclusion,  that   LIGHT   WAS   NOT   HOMOGENEOUS,   BUT   CONSISTED   OF   RAYS,  SOME   OF   WHICH   WERE   MORE     REFRANGIBLE     THAN     OTHERS.        This  profound   and   beautiful   discovery   opened   up   a   new   era   in   the  History   of   Optics.   As   bearing,   however,   directly   upon   the   construc  tion   of   telescopes,   he   saw   that   a   lens   refracting   exactly   like   a   prism  would   necessarily   bring   the   different   rays   to   different   foci,   at  different   distances   from   the   glass,   confusing   and   rendering   the  vision   indistinct.   Taking   for   granted   that   all   bodies   produced  spectra   of   ^   jtial   length,   he   dismissed   all   further   consideration   of  the   refracting   instrument,   and   took   up   the   principle   of   reflection.  Rays   of   all   colours,   he   found,   were   reflected   regularly,   so   that   the  angle   of   reflection   was   equal   to   the   angle   of   incidence,   and   hence  he   concluded   that   ojitical   instruments   might   be   brought   to   any  degree   of   perfection   imaginable,   provided   reflecting   specula   of  the   requisite   figure   and   finish   could   be   obtained.   At   this   stage  of   his   optical   researches,   he   was   forced   to   leave   Cambridge   on  account   of   the   plague   which   was   then   desolating   England.  He   retired   to   Woolsthorpe.   The   old   manor-house,   in   which   he  was   born,   was   situated   in   a   beautiful   little   valley,   on   the   west   side  of   the   river   Witham   ;   and   here   in   the   quiet   home   of   his   boyhood,  2

Towards   the   close   of   a   pleasant   day   in   the   early   autumn   of  1666,   he   was   seated   alone   beneath   a   tree,   in   his   garden,   absorbed  in   meditation.   He   was   a   slight   young   man   ;   in   the   twenty-fourth  year   of   his   age   ;   his   countenance   mild   and   full   of   thought.   For  a   century   previous,   the   science   of   Astronomy   had   advanced   with  rapid   strides.   The   human   mind   had   risen   from   the   gloom   and  bondage   of   the   middle   ages,   in   unparalleled   vigour,   to   unfold   the  system,   to   investigate   the   phenomena,   and   to   establish   the   laws  of   the   heavenly   bodies.   Copernicus,   Tycho   Brahe,   Kepler,  Galileo,   and   others   had   prepared   and   lighted   the   way   for   him  who   was   ta   give   to   their   labour   its   just   value,   and   to   their   genius  its   true   lustre.   At   his   bidding   isolated   facts   were   to   take   order  as   parts   of   one   harmonious   whole,   and   sagacious   conjectures   grow  luminous   in   the   certain   splendour   of   demonstrated   truth.   And  this   ablest   man   had   come  was   here.   His   mind,   familiar   with  the   knowledge   of   past   effort,   and   its   unequalled   faculties   develop  ed   in   transcendant   strength,   was   now   moving   on   to   the   very  threshold   of   Its   grandest   achievement.   Step   by   step   the   untrod  den   path   was   measured,   till,   at   length,   the   entrance   seemed   dis  closed,   and   the   tireless   explorer   to   stand   amid   the   first   opening  wonders   of   the   universe.  The   nature   of   gravity  that   mysterious   power   which   causes  all   bodies   to   descend   towards   the   centre   of   the   earth  had,   in  deed,   dawned   upon   him.   And   reason   busily   united   link   to   link  of   that   chain   which   was   yet   to   be   traced   joining   the   least   to   the  vastest,   the   most   remote   to   the   nearest,   in   one   harmonious   bond.  From   the   bottoms   of   the   deepest   caverns   to   the   summits   of   the  highest   mountains,   this   power   suffers   no   sensible   change   :   may   not  its   action,   then,   extend   to   the   moon   ?   Undoubtedly   :   and   furthei  reflection   convinced   him   that   such   a   power   might   be   .sufficient   for  retaining   that   luminary   in   her   orbit   round   the   earth.   But,   though  this   power   suffers   no   sensible   variation,   in   the   little   change   of  distance   from   the   earth's   centre,   at   which   we   may   place   our-  yet,   at   the   distance   of   the   moon,   :miy   not   its   force   undergo

The   conjecture   appeared   most   proba  ble   :   and,   in   order   to   estimate   what   the   degree   of   diminution  might   be,   he   considered   that   if   the   moon   be   retained   in   her   orbit  by   the   force   of   gravity,   the   primary   planets   must   also   be   carried  round   the   sun   by   the   like   power;   and,   by   comparing   the   periods  of   the   several   planets   with   their   distances   from   the   sun,   he   found  that,   if   they   were   held   in   their   courses   by   any   power   like   gravity,  its   strength   must   decrease   in   the   duplicate   proportion   of   the   in  crease   of   distance.   In   forming   this   conclusion,   he   supposed   the  planets   to   move   in   perfect   circles,   concentric   to   the   sun.   Now  was   this   the   law   of   the   moon's   motion   ?   Was   such   a   force,   em  anating   from   the   earth   and   directed   to   the   moon,   sufficient,   when  diminished   as   the   square   of   the   distance,   to   retain   her   in   her  orbit   ?   To   ascertain   this   master-fact,   he   compared   the   space  through   which   heavy   bodies   fall,   in   a   second   of   time,   at   a   given  distance   from   the   centre   of   the   earth,   namely,   at   its   surface,   with  the   space   through   which   the   moon   falls,   as   it   were,   to   the   earth,  in   the   same   time,   while   revolving   in   a   circular   orbit.   He   was  absent   from   books   ;   and,   therefore,   adopted,   in   computing   the  earth's   diameter,   the   common   estimate   of   sixty   miles   to   a   degree  of   latitude   as   then   in   use   among   geographers   and   navigators.  The   result   of   his   calculations   did   not,   ot   course,   answer   his   ex  pectations   ;   hence,   he   concluded   that   some   other   cause,   beyond   the  reach   of   observation  analogous,   perhaps,   to   the   vortices   of   Des  cartes  joined   its   action   to   that   of   the   power   of   gravity   upon   the  rnooil.   Though   by   no   means   satisfied,   he   yet   abandoned   awhile  further   inquiry,   and   remained   totally   silent   upon   the   subject.  These   rapid   marches   in   the   career   of   discovery,   combined   with  the   youth   of   Newton,   seem   to   evince   a   penetration   the   most  lively,   and   an   invention   the   most   exuberant.   But   in   him   there  was   a   conjunction   of   influences   as   extraordinary   as   fortunate.  Study,   unbroken,   persevering   and   profound   carried   on   its   inform  ing   and   disciplining   work   upon   a   genius,   natively   the   greatest,  and   rendered   freest   in   its   movements,   and   clearest   in   its   vision,  through   the   untrammelling   and   enlig}   tenirig   power   of   religion.  And,   in   this   happy   concurrence,   are   to   be   sought   the   elements   of  those   amazing   abilities,   which,   grasping,   with   equal   facility,   the

In   1667,   Newton   was   made   a   Junior   Fellow   ;   and,   in   the   year  following,   he   took   his   degree   of   Master   of   Arts,   and   was   appoint  ed   to   a   Senior   Fellowship.  On   his   return   to   Cambridge,   in   1668,   he   resumed   his   optical  labours.   Having   thought   of   a   delicate   method   of   polishing   metal,  he   proceeded   to   the   construction   of   his   newly   projected   reflect  ing   telescope   ;   a   small   specimen   of   which   he   actually   made   with  his   own   hands,   It   was   six   inches   long   ;   and   magnified   about  forty   times   ;  a   power   greater   than   a   refracting   instrument   of   six  feet   tube   could   exert   with   distinctness.   Jupiter,   with   his   four  satellites,   and   the   horns,   or   moon-like   phases   of   Venus   were  plainly   visible   through   it.   THIS   WAS   THE   FIRST   REFLECTING  TELESCOPE      EVER      EXECUTED      AND      DIRECTED      TO      THE      HEAVENS.  He

He   thought   Huygens   the   most   elegant   of   any  mathematical   writer   of   modern   times,   and   the   most   just   imitator  of   the   ancients.   Of   their   taste   and   form   of   demonstration,   Sir  Isaac   always   professed   himself   a   great   admirer.   I   have   heard  him   even   censure   himself   for   not   following   them   yet   more   closely  than   he   did   ;   and   speak   with   regret   of   his   mistake   at   the   begin  ning   of   his   mathematical   studies,   in   applying   himself   to   the   works  of   Descartes   and   other   algebraic   writers,   before   he   had   considered  the   elements   of   Euclid   with   that   attention   which   so   excellent   a  writer   deserves."  "   Though   his   memory   was   much   decayed,"   continues   Dr.   Pem-  berton,   "he   perfectly   understood   his   own   writings."   And   even  this   failure   of   memory,   we   would   suggest,   might   have   been   more  apparent   than   real,   or,   in   medical   terms,   more   the   result   of   func  tional   weakness   than   organic   decay.   Newton   seems   never   to  have   confided   largely   to   his   memory  :   and   as   this   faculty   mani  fests   the   most   susceptibility   to   cultivation   ;   so,   in   the   neglect   of  due   exercise,   it   more   readily   and   plainly   shows   a   diminution   of  its   powers.  Equanimity   and   temperance   had,   indeed,   preserved   Newton  singularly   free   from   all   mental   and   bodily   ailment.   His   hair   was,  to   the   last,   quite   thick,   though   as   white   as   silver.   He   never  made   use   of   spectacles,   and   lost   but   one   tooth   to   the   day   of   his  death.   He   was   of   middle   stature,   well-knit,   and,   in   the   latter  part   of   his   life,   somewhat   inclined   to   be   corpulent.   Mr.   Conduit  says,   "   he   had   a   very   lively   and   piercing   eye,   a   comely   and   gra  cious   aspect,   with   a   fine   head   of   hair,   white   as   silver,   without   any  baldness,   and   when   his   peruke   was   off   was   a   venerable   sight."  According   to   Bishop   Atterbury,   "in   the   whole   air   of   his   face   and  make   there   was   nothing   of   that   penetrating   sagacity   which  appears   in   his   compositions.   He   had   something   rather   languid  in   his   look   and   manner   which   did   not   raise   any   great   expectation

He   was   a   short,   well-  set   man.   He   was   full   of   thought,   and   spoke   very   little   in   com  pany,   so   that   his   conversation   was   not   agreeable.   When   he   rode  in   his   coach,   one   arm   would   be   out   of   his   coach   on   one   side   and  the   other   on   the   other."   These   different   accounts   we   deem  easily   reconcilable.   In   the   rooms   of   the   Royal   Society,   in   the  street,   or   in   mixed   assemblages,   Newton's   demeanour  always  courteous,   unassuming   and   kindly  still   had   in   it   the   overawings  of   a   profound   repose   and   reticency,   out   of   which   the   communica  tive   spirit,   and   the   "lively   and   piercing   eye"   would   only   gleam  in   the   quiet   and   unrestrained   freedom   of   his   own   fire-side.  "   But   this   I   immediately   discovered   in   him,"   adds   Pemberton,  still   further,   "which   at   once   both   surprised   and   charmed   me.  Neither   his   extreme   great   age,   nor   his   universal   reputation   had  rendered   him   stiff   in   opinion,   or   in   any   degree   elated.   Of   this   I  had   occasion   to   have   almost   daily   experience.   The   remarks   I  continually   sent   him   by   letters   on   his   Principia,   were   received  with   the   utmost   goodness.   These   were   so   far   from   being   any  ways   displeasing   to   him,   that,   on   the   contrary,   it   occasioned   him  to   speak   many   kind   things   of   me   to   my   friends,   and   to   honour   me  with   a   public   testimony   of   his   good   opinion."   A   modesty,   open  ness,   and   generosity,   peculiar   to   the   noble   and   comprehensive  spirit   of   Newton.   "   Full   of   wisdom   and   perfect   in   beauty,"   yet  not   lifted   up   by   pride   nor   corrupted   by   ambition.   None,   how  ever,   knew   so   well   as   himself   the   stupendousness   of   his   discoveries  in   comparison   with   all   that   had   been   previously   achieved  ;   and  none   realized   so   thoroughly   as   himself   the   littleness   thereof   in  comparison   with   the   vast   region   still   unexplored.   A   short   time  before   his   death   he   uttered   this   memorable   sentiment:  "   I   do   not  know   what   I   may   appear   to   the   world  ;   but   to   myself   I   seem   to  have   been   only   like   a   boy   playing   on   the   sea-shore,   and   diverting  myself   in   now   and   then   finding   a   smoother   pebble   or   a   prettier  shell   than   ordinary,   while   the   great   ocean   of   truth   lay   all   undis  covered   before   me."   How   few   ever   reach   the   shore   even,   much  less   find   "a   smoother   pebble   or   a   prettier   shell!"  Newton   had   now   resided   about   two   years   at   Kensington  ;   and
--- Page 67 ---
LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   59  the   air   which   he   enjoyed   there,   and   the   state   of   absolute   rest,  proved   of   great   benefit   to   him.   Nevertheless   he   would   occasion  ally   go   to   town.   And   on   Tuesday,   the   28th   of   February,   1727,  he   proceeded   to   London,   for   the   purpose   of   presiding   at   a   meeting  of   the   Royal   Society.   At   this   time   his   health   was   considered,  by   Mr.   Conduit,   better   than   it   had   been   for   many   years.   But  the   unusual   fatigue   he   was   obliged   to   suffer,   in   attending   the  meeting,   and   in   paying   and   receiving   visits,   speedily   produced   a  violent   return   of   the   affection   in   the   bladder.   He   returned   to  Kensington   on   Saturday,   the   4th   of   March.   Dr.   Mead   and   Dr.  Cheselden   attended   him  ;   they   pronounced   his   disease   to   be   the  stone,   and   held   out   no   hopes   of   recovery.   On   Wednesday,   the  15th   of   March,   he   seemed   a   little   better;   and   slight,   though  groundless,   encouragement   was   felt   that   he   might   survive   the  attack.   From   the   very   first   of   it,   his   sufferings   had   been   intense.  Paroxysm   followed   paroxysm,   in   quick   succession   :   large   drops  )f   sweat   rolled   down   his   face   ;   but   not   a   groan,   not   a   complaint,  not   the   least   mark   of   peevishness   or   impatience   escaped   him   :  and   during   the   short   intervals   of   relief,   he   even   smiled   and   con  versed   with   his   usual   composure   and   cheerfulness.   The   flesh  quivered,   but   the   heart   quaked   not  ;   the   impenetrable   gloom   was  settling   down  :   the   Destroyer   near  ;   the   portals   of   the   tomb  opening,   still,   arnid   this   utter   wreck   and   dissolution   of   the   mortal,  the   immortal   remained   serene,   unconquerable  :   the   radiant   light  broke   through   the   gathering   darkness  ;   and   Death   yielded   up   its  sting,   and   the   grave   its   victory.   On   Saturday   morning,   18th,  he   read   the   newspapers,   and   carried   on   a   pretty   long   conversation  with   Dr.   Mead.   His   senses   and   faculties   were   then   strong   and  vigorous   ;   but   at   six   o'clock,   the   same   evening,   he   became   insen  sible   ;   and   in   this   state   he   continued   during   the   whole   of   Sunday,  and   till   Monday,   the   20th,   when   he   expired,   between   one   and  two   o'clock   in   the   morning,   in   the   eighty-fifth   year   of   his   age.  And   these   were   the   last   days   of   Isaac   Newton.   Thus   closed  the   career   of   one   of   earth's   greatest   and   best   men.   His   mission  was   fulfilled.   Unto   the   Giver,   in   many-fold   addition,   the   talents  were   returned.   While   it   was   yet   day   he   had   worked  ;   and   for  the   night   that   quickly   cometh   he   was   not   unprepared.   Full   of

His   body   was   placed   in   Westminster   Abbey,   with   the   state  and   ceremonial   that   usually   attended   the   interment   of   the   most  distinguished.   In   1731,   his   relatives,   the   inheritors   of   his   personal  estate,   erected   a   monument   to   his   memory   in   the   most   conspicu  ous   part   of   the   Abbey,   which   had   often   been   refused   by   the   dean  and   chapter   to   the   greatest   of   England's   nobility.   During   the  same   year   a   medal   was   struck   at   the   Tower   in   his   honour   ;   arid,  in   1755,   a   full-length   statue   of   him,   in   white   marble,   admirably  executed,   by   Roubiliac,   at   the   expense   of   Dr.   Robert   Smith,   was  erected   in   the   ante-chamber   of   Trinity   College,   Cambridge.  There   is   a   painting   executed   in   the   glass   of   one   of   the   windows  of   the   same   college,   made   pursuant   to   the   will   of   Dr.   Smith,   who  left   five   hundred   pounds   for   that   purpose.  Newton   left   a   personal   estate   of   about   thirty-two   thousand  pounds.   It   was   divided   among   his   four   nephews   and   four   nieces  of   the   half   blood,   the   grand-children   of   his   mother,   by   the   Reve  rend   Mr.   Smith.   The   family   estates   of   Woolsthorpe   arid   Sustern  fell   to   John   Newton,   the   heir-at-law,   whose   great   grand-father  was   Sir   Isaac's   uncle.   Before   his   death   he   made   an   equitable  distribution   of   his   two   other   estates  :   the   one   in   Berkshire   to   the  sons   and   daughter   of   a   brother   of   Mrs.   Conduit  ;   and   the   other,  at   Kensington,   to   Catharine,   the   only   daughter   of   Mr.   Conduit,  and   who   afterward   became   Viscountess   Lymington.   Mr.   Con  duit   succeeded   to   the   offices   of   the   Mint,   the   duties   of   which   he  had   discharged   during   the   last   two   years   of   Sir   Isaac's   life.  Our   author's   works   are   found   in   the   collection   of   Castilion,  Berlin,   1744,   4to.   8   torn.;   in   Bishop   Horsley's   Edition,   London,  1779,   4to.   5   vol.;   in   the   Biographia   Brittannica,   &c.   Newton  also   published   Bern.   Varcnii   Geographia,   &c.,   1681,   8vo.  There   are,   however,   numerous   manuscripts,   letters,   and   other  papers,   which   have   never   been   given   to   the   world:   these   are  preserved,   in   various   collections,   namely,   in   the   library   of   Trinity  College,   Cambridge  ;   in   the   library   of   Corpus   Christi   College,  Oxford  ;   in   the   library   of   Lord   Macclesfield  :   and,   lastly   arid

Everything   appertaining   to   Newton   has   been   kept   and   che  rished   with   peculiar   veneration.   Different   memorials   of   him   are  preserved   in   Trinity   College,   Cambridge   ;   in   the   rooms   of   the  Royal   Society,   of   London   :   and   in   the   Museum   of   the   Royal  Society   of   Edinburgh.  The   manor-house,   at   Woolsthorpe,   was   visited   by   Dr.   Stuke  ley,   in   October,   1721,   who,   in   a   letter   to   Dr.   Mead,   written   in  1727,   gave   the   following   description   of   it:  "  'Tis   built   of   stone,  as   is   the   way   of   the   country   hereabouts,   and   a   reasonably   good  one.   They   led   me   up   stairs   and   showed   me   Sir   Isaac's   stud}-,  where   I   supposed   he   studied,   when   in   the   country,   in   his   younger  days,   or   perhaps   when   he   visited   his   mother   from   the   University.  I   observed   the   shelves   were   of   his   own   making,   being   pieces   of  deal   boxes,   which   probably   he   sent   his   books   and   clothes   down  in   on   those   occasions.   There   were,   some   years   ago,   two   or   threr  hundred   books   in   it   of   his   father-in-law,   Mr.   Smith,   which   Sir  Isaac   gave   to   Dr.   Newton,   of   our   town."   The   celebrated   apple-  tree,   the   fall   of   one   of   the   apples   of   which   is   said   to   have   turned  the   attention   of   Newton   to   the   subject   of   gravity,   was   destroyed  by   the   wind   about   twenty   years   ago  ;   but   it   has   been   preserved  in   the   form   of   a   chair.   The   house   itself   has   been   protected   with  religious   care.   It   was   repaired   in   1798,   and   a   tablet   of   white  marble   put   up   in   the   room   where   our   author   was   born,   with   the  follow,  ng   inscription   :  "   Sir   Isaac   Newton,   son   of   John   Newton,   Lord   of   the   Manor  of   Woolsthorpe,   was   born   in   this   room,   on   the   25th   of   December,  1642."  Nature   and   Nature's   Laws   wei-e   hid   in   night,  God   said,   "   Let   NEWTON   be,"   and   all   was   light.

THE      AUTHOR'S     PREFACE  SINCE   the   ancients   (as   we   are   told   by   Pappus),   made   great   account   oi  the   science   of   mechanics   in   the   investigation   of   natural   things  :   and   the  moderns,   laying   aside   substantial   forms   and   occult   qualities,   have   endeav  oured   to   subject   the   phenomena   of   nature   to   the   laws   of   mathematics,   I  have   in   this   treatise   cultivated   mathematics   so   far   as   it   regards   philosophy.  The   ancients   considered   mechanics   in   a   twofold   respect  ;   as   rational,   which  proceeds   accurately   by   demonstration   ;   and   practical.   To   practical   me  chanics   all   the   manual   arts   belong,   from   which   mechanics   took   its   name.  Rut   as   artificers   do   not   work   with   perfect   accuracy,   it   comes   to   pass   that  mechanics   is   so   distinguished   from   geometry,   that   what   is   perfectly   accu  rate   is   called   geometrical  ,   what   is   less   so,   is   called   mechanical.   But   the  errors   are   not   in   the   art,   but   in   the   artificers.   He   that   works   with   less  accuracy   is   an   imperfect   mechanic  ;   and   if   any   could   work   with   perfect  accuracy,   he   would   be   the   most   perfect   mechanic   of   all  ;   for   the   description  if   right   lines   and   circles,   upon   which   geometry   is   founded,   belongs   to   me  chanics.   Geometry   does   not   teach   us   to   draw   these   lines,   but   requires  them   to   be   drawn   ;   for   it   requires   that   the   learner   should   f.rst   be   taught  to   describe   these   accurately,   before   he   enters   upon   geometry   ;   then   it   shows  how   by   these   operations   problems   may   be   solved.   To   describe   right   lines  and   circles   are   problems,   but   not   geometrical   problems.   The   solution   of  these   problems   is   required   from   mechanics  ;   and   by   geometry   the   use   of  them,   when   so   solved,   is   shown   ;   and   it   is   the   glory   of   geometry   that   from  those   few   principles,   brought   from   without,   it   is   able   to   produce   so   many  things.   Therefore   geometry   is   founded   in   mechanical   practice,   and   is  nothing   but   that   part   of   universal   mechanics   which   accurately   proposes  and   demonstrates   the   art   of   measuring.   But   since   the   manual   arts   are  chiefly   conversant   in   the   moving   of   bodies,   it   comes   to   pass   that   geometry  is   commonly   referred   to   their   magnitudes,   and   mechanics   to   their   motion.  In   this   sense   rational   mechanics   will   be   the   science   of   motions   resulting  from   any   forces   whatsoever,   and   of   the   forces   required   to   produce   any   mo  tions,   accurately   proposed   and   demonstrated.   This   part   of   mechanics   was
--- Page 74 ---
i:;vm   THE   AUTHOR   &   PREFACE.  cultivated   by   the   ancients   in   the   five   powers   which   relate   to   manual   arts,  who   considered   gravity   (it   not   being   a   manual   power),   ho   Otherwise   than  as   it   moved   weights   by   those   powers.   Our   design   not   respecting   arts,   but  philosophy,   and   our   subject   not   manual   but   natural   powers,   we   consider  chiefly   those   things   which   relate   to   gravity,   levity,   elastic   force,   the   resist  ance   of   fluids,   and   the   like   forces,   whether   attractive   or   impulsive  ;   and  therefore   we   offer   this   work   as   the   mathematical   principles   :f   philosophy  ;   for  all   the   difficulty   of   philosophy   seems   to   consist   in   this  from   the   phenom  ena   of   motions   to   investigate   the   forces   of   nature,   and   then   from   these  forces   to   demonstrate   the   other   phenomena  ;   and   to   this   end   the   general  propositions   in   the   first   and   second   book   are   directed.   In   the   third   book  we   give   an   example   of   this   in   the   explication   of   the   System   of   the   World   :  for   by   the   propositions   mathematically   demonstrated   in   the   former   books,  we   in   the   third   derive   from   the   celestial   phenomena   the   forces   of   gravity  with   which   bodies   tend   to   the   sun   and   the   several   planets.   Then   from   these  forces,   by   other   propositions   which   are   also   mathematical,   we   deduce   the   mo  tions   of   the   planets,   the   comets,   the   moon,   and   the   sea.   I   wish   we   could   do-  rive   the   rest   of   the   phenomena   of   nature   by   the   same   kind   of   reasoning   from  mechanical   principles;   for   I   am   induced   by   many   reasons   to   suspect   that  they   may   all   depend   upon   certain   forces   by   which   the   part

,   which   is   certainly   the   same   always   and   every  where,   could   produce   no   variety   of   things.   All   that   diversity   of  natural   things   which   we   find   suited   to   different   times   and   places  could   arise   from   nothing   but   the   ideas   and   will   of   a   Being   neces  sarily   existing."  Thus,   the   diligent   student   of   science,   the   earnest   seeker   of  truth,   led,   as   through   the   courts   of   a   sacred   Temple,   wherein,   at  each   step,   new   wonders   meet   the   eye,   till,   as   a   crowning   grace,  they   stand   before   a   Holy   of   Holies,   and   learn   that   all   science   and  all   truth   are   one   which   hath   its   beginning   and   its   end   in   the  knowledge   of   Him   whose   glory   the   heavens   declare,   and   whose  handiwork   the   firmament   showeth   forth.  The   introduction   of   the   pure   and   lofty   doctrines   of   the   PRIN-  CIPIA   was   perseveringly   resisted.   Descartes,  with   his   system   of  vortices,   had   sown   plausibly   to   the   imagination,   and   error   had  struck   down   deeply,   and   shot   up   luxuriantly,   not   only   in   the  popular,   but   in   the   scientific   mind.   Besides   the   idea  in   itself   so  simple   and   so   grand  that   the   great   masses   of   the   planets   were

This   remark   applies   particularly   to   the  continent.   Leibnitz   misapprehended   ;   Huygens   in   part   rejected   ;  John   Bernouilli   opposed   ;   and   Fontenelle   never   received   the   doc  trines   of   the   PRINCIPIA.   So   that,   the   saying   of   Voltaire   is   prob  ably   true,   that   though   Newton   survived   the   publication   of   his  great   work   more   than   forty   years,   yet,   at   the   time   of   his   death,  lie   had   not   above   twenty   followers   out   of   England.  But   in   England,   the   reception   of   our   author's   philosophy   was  rapid   and   triumphant.   His   own   labours,   while   Lucasian   Pro  fessor   ;   those   of   his   successors   in   that   Chair  Whiston   and  Saunderson   ;   those   of   Dr.   Samuel   Clarke,   Dr.   Laughton,   Roger  Cotes,   and   Dr.   Bentley   ;   the   experimental   lectures   of   Dr.   Keill  and   Desaguliers   ;   the   early   and   powerful   exertions   of   David  Gregory   at   Edinburgh,   and   of   his   brother   James   Gregory   at   St.  Andrew's,   tended   to   diffuse   widely   in   England   and   Scotland   a  knowledge   of,   and   taste   for   the   truths   of   the   PRINCIPIA.   Indeed,  its   mathematical   doctrines   constituted,   from   the   first,   a   regular  part   of   academical   instruction  ;   while   its   physical   truths,   given   to  the   public   in   popular   lectures,   illustrated   by   experiments,   had,  before   the   lapse   of   twenty   )   (   ar.s,   become   familiar   to,   and   adopted  by   the   general   mind.   Pemberton's   popular   "   View   of   Sir   Isaac  Newton's   Philosophy"   was   published,   in   1728   ;   and   the   year   after  ward,   an   English   translation   of   the   PRINCIPIA,   and   System   of   the  World,   by   Andrew   Motte.   And   since   that   period,   the   labours   of  Le   Seur   and   Jacquier,   of   Thorpe,   of   Jebb,   of   Wright   and   others  have   greatly   contributed   to   display   the   most   hidden   treasures   of  the   PRINCIPIA.  About   the   time   of   the   publication   of   the   Principia,   James   II.,  bent   on   re-establishing   the   Romish   Faith,   had,   among   other   ille  gal   acts,   ordered   by   mandamus,   the   University   of   Cambridge   to  confer   the   degree   of   Master   of   Arts   upon   an   ignorant   monk.  Obedience   to   this   mandate   was   resolutely   refused.   Newton   was  one   of   the   nine   delegates   chosen   to   defend   the   independence   of  the   University.   They   appeared   before   the   High   Court  ;  and

The   prominent  part   which   our   author   took   in   these   proceedings,   and   his   eminence  in   the   scientific   world,   induced   his   proposal   as   one   of   the   parlia  mentary   representatives   of   the   University.   He   was   elected,   in  1688,   and   sat   in   the   Convention   Parliament   till   its   dissolution.  After   the   first   year,   however,   he   seems   to   have   given   little   or   no  attention   to   his   parliamentary   duties,   being   seldom   absent   from  the   University   till   his   appointment   in   the   Mint,   in   1695.  Newton   began   his   theological   researches   sometime   previous   to  1691   ;   in   the   prime   of   his   years,   and   in   the   matured   vigour   of  his   intellectual   powers.   From   his   youth,   as   we   have   seen,   he  had   devoted   himself   with   an   activity   the   most   unceasing,   and   an  energy   almost   superhuman   to   the   discovery   of   physical   truth   ;  giving   to   Philosophy   a   new   foundation,   and   to   Science   a   new  temple.   To   pass   on,   then,   from   the   consideration   of   the   material,  more   directly   to   that   of   the   spiritual,   was   a   natural,   nay,   with   so  large   and   devout   a   soul,   a   necessary   advance.   The   Bible   was   to  him   of   inestimable   worth.   In   the   elastic   freedom,   which   a   pure  and   unswerving   faith   in   Him   of   Nazareth   gives,   his   mighty   facul  ties   enjoyed   the   only   completest   scope   for   development.   His  original   endowment,   however   great,   combined   with   a   studious  application,   however   profound,   would   never,   without   this   libera  tion   from   the   dominion   of   passion   and   sense,   have   enabled   him   to  attain   to   that   wondrous   concentration   and   grasp   of   intellect,   for  which   Fame   has   as   yet   assigned   him   no   equal.   Gratefully   he  owned,   therefore,   the'same   Author   in   the   Book   of   Nature   and   the  Book   of   Revelation.   These   were   to   him   as   drops   of   the   same  unfathomable   ocean   ;  as   outrayings   of   the   same   inner   splendour   ;  as   tones   of   the   same   ineffable   voice   ;  as   segments   of   the   same  infinite   curve.   "With   great   joy   he   had   found   himself   enabled   to  proclaim,   as   an   interpreter,   from   the   hieroglyphs   of   Creation,   the  existence   of   a   God   :   and   now,   with   greater   joy,   and   in   the   fulness  of   his   knowledge,   and   in   the   fulness   of   his   strength,   he   laboured  to   make   clear,   from   the   utterances   of   the   inspired   Word,   the   far  mightier   confirmations   of   a   Supreme   Good,   in   all   its   glorious  amplitude   of   Being   and   of   Attribute   ;   and   to   bring   the   infallible  workings   thereof   plainly   home   to   the   understandings   and   the

"affections   of   his   fellow-men  ;   and   finally   to   add   the   weight   of   his  own   testimony   in   favour   of   that   Religion,   whose   truth   is   now.   in  deed,   "   girded   with   the   iron   and   the   rock   of   a   ponderous   and   co  lossal   demonstration."  His   work,   entitled,   OBSERVATIONS   UPON   THE   PROPHECIES   OF  HOLY   WRIT,   PARTICULARLY   THE   PROPHECIES   OF   DANIEL   AND   THE  APOCALYPSE   OF   ST.   JOHN,   first   published   in   London,   in   1733   4to.  consists   of   two   parts   :   the   one   devoted   to   the   Prophecies   oi  Daniel,   and   the   other   to   the   Apocalypse   of   St.   John.   In   the   first  part,   he   treats   concerning   the   compilers   of   the   books   of   the   Old  Testament  ;  of   the   prophetic   language   ;  of   the   vision   of   the  four   beasts  ;  of   the   kingdoms   represented   by   the   feet   of   the  image   composed   of   iron   and   clay   ;  of   the   ten   kingdoms   repre  sented   by   the   ten   horns   of   the   beast  ;  of   the   eleventh   horn   of  Daniel's   fourth   beast  ;   of   the   power   which   should   change   times  and   laws   ;   of   the   kingdoms   represented   in   Daniel   by   the   ram  and   he-goat  ;  of   the   prophecy   of   the   seventy   weeks   ;  of   the  times   of   the   birth   and   passion   of   Christ  ;  of   the   prophecy   of   the  Scripture   of   Truth   ;  of   the   king   who   doeth   according   to   his   will,  and   magnified   himself   above   every   god,   and   honoured   Mahuzzims,  and   regarded   not   the   desire   of   women  ;  of   the   Mahuzzim,   hon  oured   by   the   king   who   doeth   according   to   his   will.   In   the   sec  ond   part,   he   treats   of   the   time   when   the   Apocalypse   was   written   ,  of   the   scene   of   the   vision,   and   the   relation   which   the   Apocalypse  has   to   the   book   of   the   law   of   Moses,   and   to   the   worship   of   God  in   the   temple   ;  of   the   relation   which   the   Apocalypse   has   to   the  prophecies   of   Daniel,   and   of   the   subject   of   the   prophecy   itself  Newton   regards   the   prophecies   as   given,   not   for   the   gratification  of   man's   curiosity,   by   enabling   him   to   foreknow   ;   but   for   his   con  viction   that   the   world   is   governed   by   Providence,   by   witnessing  their   fulfilment.   Enough   of   prophecy,   he   thinks,   has   already  been   fulfilled   to   afford   the   diligent   seeker   abundant   evidence   of  God's   providence.   The   whole   work   is   marked   by   profound  erudition,   sagacity   and   argument.  And   not   less   learning,   penetration   and   masterly   reasoning   are  conspicuous   in   his   HISTORICAL   ACCOUNT   OF   Two   NOTABLE  CORRUPTIONS   OF   SCRIPTURES   IN   A   LETTER   TO   A   FRIEND.   This

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   41  Treatise,   first   accurately   published   in   Dr.   Horsley's   edition   of   his  works,   relates   to   two   texts  :   the   one,   1   Epistle   of   St.   John   v.   7  ;  the   other,   1   Epistle   of   St.   Paul   to   Timothy   iii.   16.   As   this  work   had   the   effect   to   deprive   the   advocates   of   the   doctrine   of  the   Trinity   of   two   leading   texts,   Newton   has   been   looked   upon  as   an   Arian   ;   but   there   is   absolutely   nothing   in   his   writings   to  warrant   such   a   conclusion.  His   regaining   theological   works   consist   of   the   LEXICON   PRO-  PHETICUM,   which   was   left   incomplete   ;   a   Latin   Dissertation   on  the   sacred   cubit   of   the   Jews,   which   was   translated   into   English,  and   published,   in   1737.   among   the   Miscellaneous   Works   of   John  Greaves   ;   and   FOUR   LETTERS   addressed   to   Dr.   Bentlty,   contain  ing   some   arguments   in   proof   of   a   Deity.   These   Letters   were  dated   respectively   :   10th   December,   1692   ;   17th   January,   1693  ;  25th   February,   1693;   and   llth   February,   1693   the   fourth  bearing   an   earlier   date   than   the   third.   The   best   faculties   and  the   profoundest   acquirements   of   our   author   are   convincingly  manifest   in   these   lucid   and   powerful   compositions.   They   were  published   in   1756,   and   reviewed   by   Dr.   Samuel   Johnson.  Newton's   religious   writings   are   distinguished   by   their   absolute  freedom   from   prejudice.   Everywhere,   throughout   them,   there  glows   the   genuine   nobleness   of   soul.   To   his   whole   life,   indeed,  we   may   here   fitly   extend   the   same   observation.   He   was   most  richly   imbued   with   the   very   spirit   of   the   Scriptures   which   he   so  delighted   to   study   and   to   meditate   upon.   His   was   a   piety,   so  fervent,   so   sincere   and   practical,   that   it   rose   up   like   a   holy   incense  from   every   thought   and   act.   His   a   benevolence   that   not   only  willed,   but   endeavoured   the   best   for   all.   His   a   philanthropy  that   held   in   the   embracings   of   its   love   every   brother-man.  His   a   toleration   of   the   largest   and   the   truest  ;   condemning   per  secution   in   every,   even   its   mildest   form  ;   and   kindly   encouraging  each   striving   after   excellence   :  .1   toleration   that   came   not   of  indifference  for   the   immoral   and   the   impious   met   with   their  quick   rebuke  but   a   toleration   that   came   of   the   wise   humbleness  and   the   Christian   charity,   which   see,   in   the   nothingness   of   self  and   the   almightiness   of   TRUTH,   no   praise   for   the   ablest,   and   no  blame   for   th^   feeblest   in   their   strugglings   upward   to   light   and   life.

42   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON,  Tn   the   winter   of   1691-2,   on   returning   from   chapel,   one   morn  ing,   Newton   foima   tnat   a   favourite   little   dog,   called   Diamond,  had   overturned   a   lighted   taper   on   his   desk,   and   that   several   pa  pers   containing   the   results   of   certain   optical   experiments,   were  nearly   consumed.   His   only   exclamation,   on   perceiving   his   loss,  was,   "   Oh   Diamond,   Diamond,   little   knowest   thou   the   mischiel  thou   hast   done,"   Dr.   Brewster,   in   his   life   of   our   author,   gives   the  following   extract   from   the   manuscript   Diary   of   Mr.   Abraham   De  La   Pryme.   a   student   in   the   University   at   the   time   of   this   oc  currence.  "   1692.   February,   3.  What   I   heard   to-day   I   must   relate.  There   is   one   Mr.   Newton   (whom   I   have   very   oft   seen),   Fellow  of   Trinity   College,   that   is   mighty   famous   for   his   learning,   being   a  most   excellent   mathematician,   philosopher,   divine,   &c.   He   has  been   Fellow   of   the   Royal   Society   these   many   years   ;   and   among  other   very   learned   books   and   tracts,   he:s   written   one   upon   the   mathe  matical   principles   of   philosophy,   which   has   given   him   a   mighty  name,   he   having   received,   especially   from   Scotland,   abundance   of  congratulatory   letters   for   the   same  ;   but   of   all   the   books   he   ever  wrote,   there   was   one   of   colours   and   light,   established   upon   thou  sands   of   experiments   which   he   had   been   twenty   years   of   making,  and   which   had   cost   him   many   hundreds   of   pounds.   This   book  which   he   vaiued   so   much,   and   which   was   so   much   talked   of,   had  the   ill   luck   to   perish,   and   be   utterly   lost   just   when   the   learned  author   was   almost   at   pitting   a   conclusion   at   the   same,   after   this  manner  :   In   a   winter's   morning,   leaving   it   among   his   other   papers  on   his   study   table   while   he   went   to   chapel,   the   candle,   which   he  had   unfortunately   left   burning   there,   too,   catched   hold   by   some  means   of   other   papers,   and   they   fired   the   aforesaid   book,   and   ut  terly   consumed   it   and   several   other   valuable   writings   ;   arid   which  is   most   wonderful   did   no   further   mischief.   But   when   Mr.   New  ton   came   from   chapel,   and   had   seen   what   was   done,   every   one  thought   he   would   have   run   mad,   he   was   so   troubled   thereat   that  he   was   not   himself   for   a   month   after.   A   long   account   of   this   his  system   of   colours   you   may   find   in   the   Transactions   of   the   Royal  Society,   which   he   had   sent   up   to   them   long   before   this   sad   mis  chance   happened   unto   him."

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   43  It   will   be   borne   in   mind   that   all   of   Newton's   theological   wri  tings,   with   the   exception   of   the   Letters   to   Dr.   Bentley,   were  composed   before   this   event   which,   we   must   conclude,   from  Pryme's   words,   produced   a   serious   impression   upon   our   author   for  about   a   month.   But   M.   Biot,   in   his   Life   of   Newton,   relying   on   a  memorandum   contained   in   a   small   manuscript   Journal   of   Huygens,  declares   this   occurrence   to   have   caused   a   deran-gement   of   New  ton's   intellect.   M.   Blot's   opinions   and   deductions,   however,   as  well   as   those   of   La   Place,   upon   this   subject,   were   based   upon  erroneous   data,   and   have   been   overthrown   by   the   clearest   proof.  There   is   not,   in   fact,   the   least   evidence   that   Newton's   reason   was,  for   a   single   moment,   dethroned   ;   on   the   contrary,   the   testimony  is   conclusive   that   he   was,   at   all   times,   perfectly   capable   of   carry  ing   on   his   mathematical,   metaphysical   and   astronomical   inquiries.  Loss   of   sleep,   loss   of   appetite,   and   irritated   nerves   will   disturb  somewhat   the   equanimity   of   the   most   serene   ;   and   an   act   done,   or  language   employed,   under   such   temporary   discomposure,   is   not   a  just   criterion   of   the   general   tone   and   strength   of   a   man's   mind.  As   to   the   accident   itself,   we   may   suppose,   whatever   might   have  been   its   precise   nature,   that   it   greatly   distressed   him,   and,   still  further,   that   its   shock   may   have   originated   the   train   of   nervous  derangements,   which   afflicted   him,   more   or   less,   for   two   years  afterward.   Yet,   during   this   very   period   of   ill   health,   we   find   him  putting   forth   his   highest   powers.   In   1692,   he   prepared   for,   and  transmitted   to   Dr.   Wallis   the   first   proposition   of   the   Treatise   on  Quadratures,   with   examples   of   it   in   first,   second   and   third   flux  ions.   He   investigated,   in   the   same   year,   the   subject   of   haloes  ;  making   and   recording   numerous   and   important   observations   rela  tive   thereto.   Those   profound   and   beautiful   Letters   to   Dr.   Bentley  were   written   at   the   close   of   this   and   the   beginning   of   the   next  year.   In   October,   1693,   Locke,   who   was   then   about   publishing   a  second   edition   of   his   work   on   the   Human   Understanding,   request  ed   Newton   to   reconsider   his   opinions   on   innate   ideas.   And   in  1694,   he   was   zealously   occupied   in   perfecting   his   lunar   theory   ;  visiting   Flamstead,   at   the   Royal   Observatory   of   Greenwich,   in  September,   and   obtaining   a   series   of   lunar   observations   ;   and

We   now   arrive   at   the   period   when   Newton   permanently   with  drew   from   the   seclusion   of   a   collegiate,   and   entered   upon   a   more  active   and   public   life.   He   was   appointed   Warden   of   the   Mint,  in   1695,   through   the   influence   of   Charles   Montague,   Chancellor  of   the   Exchequer,   and   afterward   Earl   of   Halifax.   The   current  roin   of   the   nation   had   been   adulterated   and   debased,   and   Mon  tague   undertook   a   re-coinage.   Our   author's   mathematical   and  chemical   knowledge   proved   eminently   useful   in   accomplishing  this   difficult   and   most   salutary   reform.   In   1699,   he   was   pro  moted   to   the   Mastership   of   the   Mint  an   office   worth   twelve   or  fifteen   hundred   pounds   per   annum,   and   which   he   held   during   the  remainder   of   his   life.   He   wrote,   in   this   capacity,   an   official   Re  port   on   the   Coinage,   which   has   been   published  ;   he   also   prepared  a   Table   of   Assays   of   Foreign   Coins,   which   was   printed   at   the  end   of   Dr.   Arbuthnot's   Tables   of   Ancient   Coins,   Weights,   and  Measures,   in   1727.  Newton   retained   his   Professorship   at   Cambridge   till   1703.  But   he   had,   on   receiving   the   appointment   of   Master   of   the   Mint,  in   1699,   made   Mr.   Whiston   his   deputy,   with   all   the   emoluments  of   the   office   ;   and,   on   finally   resigning,   procured   his   nomination   to  the   vacant   Chair.  In   January   1697,   John   Bernouilli   proposed   to   the   most   distin  guished   mathematicians   of   Europe   two   problems   for   solution.  Leibnitz,   admiring   the   beauty   of   one   of   them,   requested   the   time  for   solving   it   to   be   extended   to   twelve   months  twice   the   period  originally   named.   The   delay   was   readily   granted.   Newton,   how  ever,   sent   in,   the   day   after   he   received   the   problems,   a   solution   of  them   to   the   President   of   the   Royal   Society.   Bernouilli   obtained  solutions   from   Newton,   Leibinitz   and   the   Marquis   De   L'Hopital  ;  but   Newton's   though   anonymous,   he   immediately   recognised  "  tanquam   ungue   leonem"   as   the   lion   is   known   by   his   claw.  We   may   mention   here   the   famous   problem   of   the   trajectories  proposed   by   Leibnitz,   in   1716,   for   the   purpose   of   "feeling   the  pulse   of   the   English   Analysts."   Newton   received   the   problem  about   five   o'clock   in   the   afternoon,   as   he   was   returning   from   the

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   45  Mint  ;   and   though   it   was   extremely   difficult   and   he   himself   much  fatigued,   yet   he   completed   its   solution,   the   same   evening   before  he   went   to   bed.  The   history   of   these   problems   affords,   by   direct   comparison,   a  striking   illustration   of   Newton's   vast   superiority   of   mind.   That  amazing   concentration   and   grasp   of   intellect,   of   which   we   have  spoken,   enabled   him   to   master   speedily,   and,   as   it   were,   by   a  single   effort,   those   things,   for   the   achievement   of   which,   the   many  would   essay   utterly   in   vain,   and   the   very,   very   few   attain   only  after   long   and   renewed   striving.   And   yet,   with   a   modesty   as  unparalleled   as   his   power,   he   attributed   his   successes,   not   to   any  extraordinary   sagacity,   but   solely   to   industry   and   patient   thought.  Mr-   kept   the   subject   of   consideration   constantly   before   him,   and  waited   till   the   first   dawning   opened   gradually   into   a   full   and  clear   light  ;   never   quitting,   if   possible,   the   mental   process   till   the  object   of   it   were   wholly   gained.   He   never   allowed   this   habit   of  meditation   to   appear   in   his   intercourse   with   society  ;   but   in   the  privacy   of   his   own   chamber,   or   in   the   midst   of   his   own   family,   he  gave   himself   up   to   the   deepest   abstraction.   Occupied   with   some  interesting   investigation,   he   would   often   sit   down   on   his   bedside,  after   he   rose,   and   remain   there,   for   hours,   partially   dressed.  Meal-time   would   frequently   come   and   pass   unheeded  ;   so   that,  unless   urgently   reminded,   he   would   neglect   to   take   the   re  quisite   quantity   of   nourishment.   But   notwithstanding   his   anx  iety   to   be   left   undisturbed,   he   would,   when   occasion   required,  turn   aside   his   thoughts,   though   bent   upon   the   most   intricate   re  search,   and   then,   when   leisure   served,   again   direct   them   to   the  very   point   where   they   ceased   to   act  :   and   this   he   seemed   to   ac  complish   not   so   much   by   the   force   of   his   memory,   as   by   the   force  of   his   inventive   faculty,   before   the   vigorous   intensity   of   which,   no  subject,   however   abstruse,   remained   long   unexplored.  Me   was   elected   a   member   of   the   Royal   Academy   of   Sciences  at   Paris,   in   1699,   when   that   distinguished   Body   were   empowered,  by   a   new   charter,   to   admit   a   small   number   of   foreign   associates.  In   1700,   he   communicated   to   Dr.   Halley   a   description   of   his   re  flecting   instrument   for   observing   the   moon's   distance   from   the  fixed   stars.   This   description   was   published   in   the   Philosophical
--- Page 54 ---
46   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON,  Transactions,   in   1742.   The   instrument   was   the   same   as   that  produced   by   Mr.   Hadley,   in   1731,   and   which,   under   the   name   of  Hadley's   Quadrant,   has   been   of   so   great   use   in   navigation.   On  the   assembling   of   the   new   Parliament,   in   1701,   Newton   was   re-  elected   one   of   the   members   for   the   University   of   Cambridge.   In  1703,   he   was   chosen   President   of   the   Royal   Society   of   London,  to   which   office   he   was   annually   re-elected   till   the   period   of   his  decease  about   twenty-five   years   afterward.  Our   author   unquestionably   devoted   more   labour   to,   and,   in  many   respects,   took   a   greater   pride   in   his   Optical,   than   his   other  discoveries.   This   science   he   had   placed   on   a   new   and   indestruc  tible   basis  ;   and   he   wished   not   only   to   build,   but   to   perfect   the  costly   and   glowing   structure.   He   had   communicated,   before   the  publication   of   the   PRINCIPIA,   his   most   important   researches   on  light   to   the   Royal   Society,   in   detached   papers   which   were   inserted  in   successive   numbers   of   the   Transactions  ;   but   he   did   not   pub  lish   a   connected   view   of   these   labours   till   1704,   when   they   appeared  under   the   title   of   OPTICS   :   OR,   A   TREATISE   ON   THE   REFLEXIONS,  REFRACTIONS,   INFLEXIONS   AND   COLOURS   OF   LIGHT.   To   this,  but   to   no   subsequent   edition,   were   added   two   Mathematical   Trea  tises,   entitled,   TRACTATUS   DUO   DE   SPECIEBUS   ET   MAGNITUDINE  FIGURARUM   cuRViLiNEARUM  ;   the   one   bearing   the   title   TRACTATUS  DE   QUADRATURA   CuRVARUM  ;   and   the   other,   that   of   ENUMERATIO  LINEARUM   TERTII   ORDiNis.   The   publication   of   these   Mathemati  cal   Treatises   was   made   necessary   in   consequence   of   plagiarisms  from   the   manuscripts   of   them   loaned   by   the   author   to   his   friends.  Dr.   Samuel   Clarke   published   a   Latin   translation   of   the   Optics,   in  in   1706   ;   whereupon   he   was   presented   by   Newton,   as   a   mark   of  his   grateful   approbation,   with   five   hundred   pounds,   or   one   hun  dred   pounds   for   each   of   his   children.   The   work   was   afterward  translated   into   French.   It   had   a   remarkably   wide   circulation,  and   appeared,   in   several   successive   editions,   both   in   England   and  on   the   Continent.   There   is   displayed,   particularly   on   this   Opti  cal   Treatise,   the   author's   talent   for   simplifying   and   communica  ting   the   profoundest   speculations.   It   is   a   faculty   rarely   united   to  that   of   the   highest   invention.   Newton   possessed   both   ;   and   thus  that   mental   perfectness   which   enabled   him   to   create,   to   combine,

The   honour   of   knighthood   v/as   conferred   on   our   author   in  1705.   Soon   afterward,   he   was   a   candidate   again   for   the   Repre  sentation   of   the   University,   but   was   defeated   by   a   large   majority.  It   is   thought   that   a   more   pliant   man   was   preferred   by   both   min  isters   and   electors.   Newton   was   always   remarkable   for   simplicity  of   dress,   and   his   only   known   departure   from   it   was   on   this   oc  casion,   when   he   is   said   to   have   appeared   in   a   suit   of   laced  clothes.  The   Algebraical   Lectures   which   he   had,   Juring   nine   years,  delivered   at   Cambridge,   were   published   by   Whiston,   in   1707,  under   the   title   of   ARITHMETICS   UNIVERSALIS,   SINE   DE   COMPOSI  TIONS   ET   RESOLUTIONS   ARITHMETICA   LIBER.   This   publication  is   said   to   have   been   a   breach   of   confidence   on   Whiston's   part.   Mr.  Ralphson,   not   long   afterward,   translated   the   work   into   English  ;  and   a   second   edition   of   it,   with   improvements   by   the   author,   was  issued   at   London,   1712,   by   Dr.   Machin.   Subsequent   editions,  both   in   English   and   Latin,   with   commentaries,   have   been   published.  In   June,   1709,   Newton   intrusted   the   superintendence   of   a  second   edition   of   the   PRINCIPIA   to   Roger   Cotes,   Plumian   Pro  fessor   of   Astronomy   at   Cambridge.   The   first   edition   had   been  sold   off   for   some   time.   Copies   of   the   work   had   become   very  rare,   and   could   only   be   obtained   at   several   times   their   original  cost.   A   great   number   of   letters   passed   oetween   the   author   and  Mr.   Cotes   during   the   preparation   of   the   edition,   which   finally  appeared   in   May,   1713.   It   had   many   alterations   and   improve  ments,   and   was   accompanied   by   an   admirable   Preface   from   the  pen   of   Cotes.  Our   author's   early   Treatise,   entitled,   ANALYSIS   PER   EQUATIONES  NUMERO   TERMINORUM   INFINITAS,   as   well   as   a   small   Tract,   Gearing  the   title   of   METHODUS   DIFFERENTIALS,   was   published,   witn   nis  consent,   in   1711.   The'   former   of   these,   and   the   Treatise   De  Quadratura   Curvarum,   translated   into   Englisn,   witn   a   .arge   com  mentary,   appeared   in   1745.   His   work,   entitled.   ARTIS   ANA  LYTICS   SPECIMINA,   VEL   GEOMETRIA   ANALYTICA,   was   iirs;   given  to   the   world   in   the   edition   of   Dr.   Horsley,   1779.

It   is   a   notable   fact,   in   Newton's   history,   that   he   never   volun*  tarily   published   any   one   of   his   purely   mathematical   writings  The   cause   of   this   unwillingness   in   some,   and,   in   other   instances,  of   his   indifference,   or,   at   least,   want   of   solicitude   to   put   forth   his  works   may   be   confidently   sought   for   in   his   repugnance   to   every  thing   like   contest   or   dispute.   But,   going   deeper   than   this   aver  sion,   we   find,   underlying   his   whole   character   and   running   parallel  with   all   his   discoveries,   that   extraordinary   humility   which   always  preserved   him   in   a   position   so   relatively   just   to   the   behests   of  time   and   eternity,   that   the   infinite   value   of   truth,   and   the   utter  worthlessness   of   fame,   were   alike   constantly   present   to   him.  Judging   of   his   course,   however,   in   its   more   temporary   aspect,   as  bearing   upon   his   immediate   quiet,   it   seemed   the   most   unfortunate.  For   an   early   publication,   especially   in   the   case   of   his   Method   of  Fluxions,   would   have   anticipated   all   rivalry,   and   secured   him  from   the   contentious   claims   of   Leibnitz.   Still   each   one   will   solve  the   problem   of   his   existence   in   his   own   way,   and,   with   a   manlike  Newton,   his   own,   as   we   conceive,   could   be   no   other   than   the   best  way.   The   conduct   of   Leibnitz   in   this   affair   is   quite   irreconcilable  with   the   stature   and   strength   of   the   man  ;   giant-like,   and   doing  nobly,   in   many   ways,   a   giant's   work,   yet   cringing   himself   into   the  dimensions   and   performances   of   a   common   calumniator.   Opening  in   1699,   the   discussion   in   question   continued   till   the   close   of  Leibnitz's   life,   in   1716.   We   give   the   summary   of   the   case   as  contained   in   the   Report   of   the   Committee   of   the   Royal   Society,  the   deliberately   weighed   opinion   of   which   has   been   adopted   as   an  authoritative   decision   in   all   countries.  "   We   have   consulted   the   letters   and   letter   books   in   the   custody  of   the   Royal   Society,   and   those   found   among   the   papers   of   Mr.  John   Collins,   dated   between   the   years   1669   and   1677,   inclusive   ;  and   showed   them   to   such   as   knew   and   avouched   the   hands   of   Mr.  Barrow,   Mr.   Collins,   Mr.   Oldenburg,   and   Mr.   Leibnitz  ;   and  compared   those   of   Mr.   Gregory   with   one   another,   and   with   copies  of   some   of   them   taken   in   the   hand   of   Mr.   Collins   ;   and   have  extracted   from   them   what   relates   to   the   matter   referred   to   us  :  all   which   extracts,   herewith   delivered   to   you,   we   believe   to   be  genuine   and   authentic.

LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.   49  "   I.   Mr.   Leibnitz   was   in   London   in   the   beginning   of   the   year  1673   ;   and   went   thence   in   or   about   March,   to   Paris,   where   he  kept   a   correspondence   with   Mr.   Collins,   by   means   of   Mr.   Olden  burg,   till   about   September,   1676,   and   then   returned,   by   London  and   Amsterdam,   to   Hanover:   and   that   Mr.   Collins   was   very   free  in   communicating   to   able   mathematicians   what   he   had   received  from   Mr,   Newton   and   Mr.   Gregory.  "   II.   That   when   Mr.   Leibnitz   was   the   first   time   in   London,  he   contended   for   the   invention   of   another   differential   method,  properly   so   called   ;   and,   notwithstanding   he   was   shown   by   Dr.  Pell   that   it   was   Newton?s   method,   persisted   in   maintaining   it   to  be   his   own   invention,   by   reason   that   he   had   found   it   by   himself  without   knowing   what   Newton   had   done   before,   and   had   much  improved   it.   And   we   find   no   mention   of   his   having   any   other  differential   method   than   Newton's   before   his   letter   of   the   21st   of  June,   1677,   which   was   a   year   after   a   copy   of   Mr.   Newton's   letter  of   the   10th   of   December,   1672,   had   been   sent   to   Paris   to   be  communicated   to   him  ;   and   above   four   years   after   Mr.   Collins  began   to   communicate   that   letter   to   his   correspondents   ;   in   which  letter   the   method   of   fluxions   was   sufficiently   described   to   any  intelligent   person.  "III.   That   by   Mr.   Newton's   letter,   of   the   13th   of   June,   1676  it   appears   that   he   had   the   method   of   fluxions   above   five   years  before   the   writing   of   that   letter.   And   by   his   Analysis   per   ^Equa-  tiones   numero   Terminorum   Infmitas,   communicated   by   Dr.   Barrow  to   Mr.   Collins,   in   July,   1669,   we   find   that   he   had   invented   the  method   before   that   time.  "IV.   That   the   differential   method   is   one   and   the   same   with  the   method   of   fluxions,   excepting   the   name   and   mode   of   notation   ;  Mr.   Leibnitz   calling   those   quantities   differences   which   Mr.   Newton  calls   moments,   or   fluxions  ;   and   marking   them   with   a   letter   d  a  mark   not   used   by   Mr.   Newton.  "   And,   therefore,   we   take   the   proper   question   to   be,   not   who  invented   this   or   that   method,   but,   who   was   the   first   inventor   of  the   method   ?   And   we   believe   that   those   who   have   reputed   Mr.  Leibnitz   the   first   inventor   knew   little   or   nothing   of   his   correspond  ence   with   Mr.   Collins   and   Mr.   Oldenburg   long   before,   nor   of   Mr.

Newton's   hiving   that    method    above    fifteen   years   before    Mr  Leibnitz   began   to   publish   it   in   the   Acta   Eruditorum   of   Leipsic.  "   For   which   reason   we   reckon   Mr.   Newton   the   first   inventor  ;  and   are   of   opinion   that   Mr.   Keill,   in   asserting   the   same,   has   been  no   ways   injurious   to   Mr.   Leibnitz.   And   we   submit   to   the   judg  ment   of   the   Society,   whether   the   extract   and   papers,   now   pre  sented   to   you,   together   with   what   is   extant,   to   the   same   pur  pose,   in   Dr.   Wallis's   third   volume,   may   not   deserve   to   be   made  public."  This   Report,   with   the   collection   of   letters   and   manuscripts,  under   the   title   of   COMMERCIUM   EPISTOLICUM   D.   JOHANNIS   COLLINS  ET      ALIORUM      DE     ANALYSI     PROMOTA      JuSSU      SoCIETATIS      REGIES  EDITUM,   appeared   accordingly   in   the   early   part   of   1713.   Its  publication   seemed   to   infuse   additional   bitterness   into   the   feelings  of   Leibnitz,   who   descended   to   unfounded   charges   and   empty  threats.   He   had   been   privy   counsellor   to   the   Elector   of   Han  over,   before   that   prince   was   elevated   to   the   British   throne  ;   and  in   his   correspondence,   in   1715   and   1716,   with   the   Abbe   Conti,  then   at   the   court   of   George   L,   and   with   Caroline,   Princess   of  Wales,   he   attacked   the   doctrines   of   the   PRINCIPIA,   and   indirectly  its   author,   in   a   manner   very   discreditable   to   himself,   both   as   a  lear

ned   and   as   an   honourable   man.   His   assaults,   however,   were  triumphantly   met;   and,   to   the   complete   overthrow   of   his   rival  pretensions,   Newton   was   induced   to   give   the   finishing   blow.   The  verdict   is   universal   and   irreversible   that   the   English   preceded  the   German   philosopher,   by   at   least   ten   years,   in   the   invention  of   fluxions.   Newton   could   not   have   borrowed   from   Leibnitz  ;  but   Leibnitz   might   have   borrowed   from   Newton.   A   new   edition  of   the   Commercium   Epistolicum   was   published   in   1722-5   (?)   ;   but  neither   in   this,   nor   in   the   former   edition,   did   our   author   take   any  part.   The   disciples,   enthusiastic,   capable   and   ready,   effectually  shielded,   with   the   buckler   of   Truth,   the   character   of   the   Master,  whose   own   conduct   throughout   was   replete   with   delicacy,   dignity  and   justice.   He   kept   aloof   from   the   controversy  in   which   Dr.  Keill   stood   forth   as   the   chief   representative   of   the   Newtonian  side  till   the   very   last,   when,   for   the   satisfaction   of   the   King,  George   L.   rather   than   for   his   own,   he   consented   to   put   forth   his

A   petition   to   have   inventions   for   promoting   the   discovery   of   the  longitude   at   sea,   suitably   rewarded,   was   presented   to   the   House  of   Commons,   in   1714.   A   committee,   having   been   appointed   to  investigate   the   subject,   called   upon   Newton   and   others   for   their  opinions.   That   of   our   author   was   given   in   writing,   A   report,  favourable   to   the   desired   measure,   was   then   taken   up,   and   a   bill  for   its   adoption   subsequently   passed.  On   the   ascension   of   George   I.,   in   1714,   Newton   became   an  object   of   profound   interest   at   court.   His   position   under   govern  ment,   his   surpassing   fame,   his   spotless   character,   and.   above   all,  his   deep   and   consistent   piety,   attracted   the   reverent   regard   of   the  Princess   of   Wales,   afterward   queen  -consort   to   George   II.   She  was   a   woman   of   a   highly   cultivated   mind,   and   derived   the   greatest  pleasure   from   conversing   with   Newton   and   corresponding   with  Leibnitz.   One   day,   in   conversation   with   her,   our   author   men  tioned   and   explained   a   new   system   of   chronology,   which   he   had  composed   at   Cambridge,   where   he   had   been   in   the   habit   "   of  refreshing   himself   with   history   and   chronology,   when   he   wac  weary   with   other   studies."   Subsequently,   in   the   year   1718,   she  requested   a   copy   of   this   interesting   and   ingenious   work   Newton,  accordingly,   drew   up   an   abstract   of   the   system   from   the   separate  papers   in   which   it   existed,   and   gave   it   to   her   on   condition   that   it  should   riot   be   communicated   to   any   other   person.   Sometime  afterward   she   requested   that   the   Abbe   Conti   might   be   allowed  to   have   a   copy   of   it   The   author   consented:   and   the   abbe  received   a   copy   of   the   manuscript,   under   the   like   injunction   and  promise   of   secrecy.   This   manuscript   bore   the   title   of   "   A   short  Chronicle,   from   the   First   Memory   of   Tilings   in   Europe,   to   the  Conquest   of   Persia,   by   Alexander   the   Great."  After   Newton   took   up   his   residence   in   London,   he   lived   in   a  style   suited   to   his   elevated   position   and   rank.   He   kept   his   car  riage,   with   an   establishment   of   three   male   and   three   female   serv  ants.   But   to   everything   like   vain   show   and   luxury   he   was   utterly  averse.   His   household   affairs,   for   the   last   twenty   years   of   his  life,   were   under   the   charge   of   his   niece,   Mrs.   Catherine   Barton,

52   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  wife   and   widow   of   Colonel   Barton  a   woman   of   great   beauty   and  accomplishment  and   subsequently   married   to   John   Conduit,   Esq.  At   home   Newton   was   distinguished   by   that   dignified   and   gentle  hospitality   which   springs   alone   from   true   nobleness.   On   all   pro  per   occasions,   he   gave   splendid   entertainments,   though   without  ostentation.   In   society,   whether   of   the   palace   or   the   cottage,  his   manner   was   self-possessed   and   urbane  ;   his   look   benign   and  affable   ;   his   speech   candid   and   modest  ;   his   whole   air   undisturb  edly   serene.   He   had   none   of   what   are   usually   called   the   singu  larities   of   genius   ;   suiting   himself   easily   to   every   company  except   that   of   the   vicious   and   wicked  ;   and   speaking   of   himself  and   others,   naturally,   so   as   never   even   to   be   suspected   of   vanity.  There   was   in   him,   if   we   may   be   allowed   the   expression,   a   WHOLE  NESS   of   nature,   which   did   not   admit   of   such   imperfections   and  weakness  the   circle   was   too   perfect,   the   law   too   constant,   and  the   disturbing   forces   too   slight   to   suffer   scarcely   any   of   those  eccentricities   which   so   interrupt   and   mar   the   movements   of   many  bright   spirits,   rendering   their   course   through   the   world   more   like  that   of   the   blazing   meteor   than   that   of   the   light   and   life-impart  ing   sun.   In   brief,   the   words   GREATNESS   and   GOODNESS   could  not,   humanly   speaking,   be   more   fitly   employed   than   when   applied  as   the   pre-eminent   characteristics   of   this   pure,   meek   and   vene  rable   sage.  In   the   eightieth   year   of   his   age,   Newton   was   seized   with  symptoms   of   stone   in   the   bladder.   His   disease   was   pronounced  incurable.   He   succeeded,   however,   by   means   of   a   strict   regimen,  and   other   precautions,   in   alleviating   his   complaint,   and   procuring  long   intervals   of   ease.   His   diet,   always   frugai,   was   now   extremely  temperate,   consisting   chiefly   of   broth,   vegetables,   and   fruit,   with,  now   and   then,   a   little   butcher   meat.   He   gave   up   the   use   of   his  carriage,   and   employed,   in   its   stead,   when   he   went   out,   a   chair.  All   invitations   to   dinner   were   declined  ;   and   only   small   parties  were   received,   occasionally,   at   his   own   house.  In   1724   he   wrote   to   the   Lord   Provost   of   Edinburgh,   offering  to   contribute   twenty   pounds   yearly   toward   the   salary   of   Mr.  Maclaurin,   provided   he   accepted   the   assistant   Professorship   of  Mathematics   in   the   University   of   that   place.   Not   only   in   the

He   was   generous   and   charitable   almost   to   a   fault.  Those,   he   would   often   remark,   who   gave   away   nothing   till   they  died,   never   gave   at   all.   His   wealth   had   become   considerable   by  a   prudent   economy  ;   but   he   regarded   money   in   no   other   light  than   as   one   of   the   means   wherewith   he   had   been   intrusted   to   do  good,   and   he   faithfully   employed   it   accordingly.  He   experienced,   in   spite   of   all   his   precautionary   measures,   a  return   of   his   complaint   in   the   month   of   August,   of   the   same   year,  1  724,   when   he   passed   a   stone   the   size   of   pea   ;   it   came   from   him  in   two   pieces,   the   one   at   the   distance   of   two   day.s   from   the   other.  Tolerable   good   health   then   followed   for   some   months.   In   Janu  ary,   1725,   however,   he   was   taken   with   a   violent   cough   and   inflam  mation   of   the   lungs.   In   consequence   of   this   attack,   he   was   pre  vailed   upon   to   remove   to   Kensington,   where   his   health   greatly  improved.   In   February   following,   he   was   attacked   in   both   feet  with   the   gout,   of   the   approach   of   which   he   had   received,   a   few  years   before,   a   slight   warning,   and   the   presence   of   which   now  produced   a   very   beneficial   change   in   his   general   health.   Mr.  Conduit,   his   nephew,   has   recorded   a   curious   conversation   which  took   place,   at   or   near   this   time,   between   himself   and   Sir   Isaac.  "I   was,   on   Sunday   night,   the   7th   March,   1724-5,   at   Kensing  ton,   with   Sir   Isaac   Newton,   in   his   lodgings,   just   after   he   was   out  of   a   fit   of   the   gout,   which   he   had   had   in   both   of   his   feet,   for   the  first   time,   in   the   eighty-third   year   of   his   age.   He   was   better   after  it,   and   his   head   clearer   and   memory   stronger   than   I   had   known  them   for   some   time.   He   then   repeated   to   me,   by   way   of   dis  course,   very   distinctly,   though   rather   in   answer   to   my   queries,  than   in   one   continued   narration,   what   he   had   often   hinted   to   me  before,   viz.  :   that   it   was   his   conjecture   (he   would   affirm   nothing)  that   there   was   a   sort   of   revolution   in   the   heavenly   bodies   ;   that  the   vapours   and   light,   emitted   by   the   sun,   which   had   their   sedi  ment,   as   water   and   other   matter,   had   gathered   themselves,   by  degrees,   into   a   body,   and   attracted   more   matter   from   the   planets,  and   at   last   made   a   secondary   planet   (viz.  :   one   of   those   that   go  round   another   planet),   and   then,   by   gathering   to   them,   and

54   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON.  attracting   more   matter,   became   a   primary   planet  ;   and   then,   bf  increasing   still,   became   a   comet,   which,   after   certain   revolutions,  by   coming   nearer   and   nearer   to   the   sun,   had   all   its   volatile   parts  condensed,   and   became   a   matter   tit   to   recruit   and   replenish   the  sun   (which   must   waste   by   the   constant   heat   and   light   it   emitted),  as   a   faggot   would   this   fire   if   put   into   it   (we   were   sitting   by   a  wood   fire),   and   that   that   would   probably   be   the   effect   of   the  comet   of   1680,   sooner   or   later   ;   for,   by   the   observations   made  upon   it,   it   appeared,   before   it   came   near   the   sun,   with   a   tail   only  two   or   three   degrees   long   ;   but,   by   the   heat   it   contracted,   in   going  so   near   the   sun,   it   seemed   to   have   a   tail   of   thirty   or   forty   degrees  when   it   went   frpm   it  ;   that   he   could   not   say   when   this   comet  would   drop   into   the   sun  ;   it   might   perhaps   have   five   or   six   revo  lutions   more   first,   but   whenever   it   did   it   would   so   much   increase  the   heat   of   the   sun   that   this   earth   would   be   burned,   and   no   ani  mals   in   it   could   live.   That   he   took   the   three   phenomena,   seen  by   Hipparchus,   Tycho   Brahe,   and   Kepler's   disciples,   to   have   been  of   this   kind,   for   he   could   not   otherwise   account   for   an   extraor  dinary   light,   as   those   were,   appearing,   all   at   once,   among   the  the   fixed   stars   (all   which   he   took   to   be   suns,   enlightening   other  planets,   as   our   sun   does   ours),   as   big   as   Mercury   or   Venus   seems  to   us,   and   gradually   diminishing,   for   sixteen   months,   and   then  sinking   into   nothing.   He   seemed   to   doubt   whether   there   were  not   intelligent   beings,   superior   to   us,   who   superintended   these  revolutions   of   the   heavenly   bodies,   by   the   direction   of   the   Supreme  Being.   He   appeared   also   to   be   very   clearly   of   opinion   that   the  inhabitants   of   this   world   were   of   short   date,   and   alledged,   as   one  reason   for   that   opinion,   that   all   arts,   as   letters,   ships,   printing,  needle,   &c.,   were   discovered   within   the   memory   of   history,   which  could   not   have   happened   if   the   world   had   been   eternal  ;   and   that  there   were   visible   marks   of   ruin   upon   it   which   could   not   be  effected   by   flood   only.   When   I   asked   him   how   this   earth   could  have   been   repeopled   if   ever   it   had   undergone   the   same   fate  it   was   threatened   with   hereafter,   by   the   comet   of   1680,   he  answered,   that   required   the   power   of   a   Creator.   He   said   he  took   all   the   planets   to   be   composed   of   the   same   matter   with   this  earth,   viz.  :   earth,   water,   stones,   &c.3   but   variously   concocted.   J

His   answer   was,   "   I   do   not   deal   in   con  jectures."   But,   on   my   talking   to   him   about   the   four   observations  that   had   been   made   of   the   comet   of   1680,   at   574   years'   distance,  and   asking   him   the   particular   times,   he   opened   his   Principia,  which   laid   on   the   table,   and   showed   me   the   particular   periods,  viz.:   1st.   The   Julium   Sidus,   in   the   time   of   Justinian,   in   1106,  in   1680.  "   And   I,   observing   that   he   said   there   of   that   comet,   '   incidet  in   corpus   solis,'   and   in   the   next   paragraph   adds,   '   stellae   fixae  refici   possunt,'   told   him   I   thought   he   owned   there   what   we   had  been   talking   about,   viz.  :   that   the   comet   would   drop   into   the   sun,  and   that   fixed   stars   were   recruited   and   replenished   by   comets  when   they   dropped   into   them  ;   and,   consequently,   that   the   sun  would   be   recruited   too  ;   and   asked   him   why   he   would   not   own   as  fully   what   he   thought   of   the   sun   as   well   as   what   he   thought   of  the   fixed   stars.   He   said,   'that   concerned   us   more;'   and,   laugh  ing,   added,   that   he   had   said   enough   for   people   to   know   his  meaning."  In   the   summer   of   1725,   a   French   translation   of   the   chronolo  gical   MS.,   of   which   the   Abbe   Conti   had   been   permitted,   some  time   previous,   to   have   a   copy,   was   published   at   Paris,   in   violation  of   all   good   faith.   The   Punic   Abbe   had   continued   true   to   his  promise   of   secrecy   while   he   remained   in   England   ;   but   no   sooner  did   he   reach   Paris   than   he   placed   the   manuscript   into   the   hands  of   M.   Freret,   a   learned   antiquarian,   who   translated   the   work,   and  accompanied   it   with   an   attempted   refutation   of   the   leading   points  of   the   system.   In   November,   of   the   same   year,   Newton   received  a   presentation   copy   of   this   publication,   which   bore   the   title   of  ABREGE   DE   CHRONOLOGIE   DE   M.

56   LIFE     OF     SIR     ISAAC     NEWTON,  was   drawn   up   by   our   author,   and   printed   in   the   Philosophical  Transactions   for   1725.   It   contained   a   history   of   the   whole  matter,   and   a   triumphant   reply   to   the   objections   of   M.   Freret.  This   answer   called   into   the   field   a   fresh   antagonist,   Father   Soueiet,  whose   five   dissertations   on   this   subject   were   chiefly   remarkable  for   the   want   of   knowledge   and   want   of   decorum,   which   they  displayed.   In   consequence   of   these   discussions,   Newton   was   in  duced   to   prepare   his   larger   work   for   the   press,   and   had   nearly  completed   it   at   the   time   of   his   death.   It   was   published   in   1728,  under   the   title   of   THE   CHRONOLOGY   OF   THE   ANCIENT   KINGDOMS  AMENDED,   TO   WHICH   is   PREFIXED   A   SHORT   CHRONICLE   FROM   THE  FIRST   MEMORY   OF   THINGS    IN     EUROPE     TO     THE     CONQUEST     OF  PERSIA   BY   ALEXANDER   THE   GREAT.   It   consists   of   six   chap  ters:   1.   On   the   Chronology   of   the   Greeks;   according   to   Whis-  ton,   our   author   wrote   out   eighteen   copies   of   this   chapter   with   his  own   hand,   differing   little   from   one   another.   2.   Of   the   Empire  of   Egypt;   3.   Of   the   Assyrian   Empire;   4.   Of   the   two   contempo  rary   Empires   of   the   Babylonians   and   Medes  ;   5.   A   Description  of   the   Temple   of   Solomon   ;   6.   Of   the   Empire   of   the   Persians   ;  this   chapter   was   not   found   copied   with   the   other   five,   but   as   it  was   discovered   among   his   papers,   arid   appeared   to   be   a   continu  ation   of   the   same   work,   the   Editor   thought   proper   to   add   it  thereto.   Newton's   LETTER   TO   A   PERSON   OF   DISTINCTION   WHO  HAD   DESIRED    HIS   OPINION   OF    THE     LEARNED     BlSHO^     LLOYD'S  HYPOTHESIS   CONCERNING   THE   FORM   OF   THE   MOST   ANCIENT  ^EAR,   closes   this   enumeration   of   his   Chronological   Writings.  A   ihird   edition   of   the   PRINCIPIA   appeared   in   1726,   with   many  changes   and   additions.   About   four   years   were   consumed   in   its  preparation   and   publication,   which   were   under   the   superintend-  ance   of   Dr.   Henry   Pemberton,   an   accomplished   mathematician,  and   the   author   of   "A   VIEW   OF   SIR   ISAAC   NEWTON'S   PHILO  SOPHY."   1728.   This   gentleman   enjoyed   numerous   opportunities  of   conversing   with   the   aged   and   illustrious   author.   "   I   found,"  says   Pemberton,   "   he   had   read   fewer   of   the   modern   mathemati  cians   than   one   could   have   expected;   but   his   own   prodigious  invention   readily   supplied   him   with   what   he   might   have   an   occa  sion   for   in   the   pursuit   of   any   subject   he   undertook.

In   the   publication   of   this   work   the   most   acute   and   universally   learned  Mr.   Edmund   H  alley   not   only   assisted   me   with   his   pains   in   correcting   the  press   and   taking   care   of   the   schemes,   but   it   was   to   his   solicitations   that   its  becoming   public   is   owing  ;   for   when   he   had   obtained   of   me   my   demonstra  tions   of   the   figure   of   the   celestial   orbits,   he   continually   pressed   me   to   com  municate   the   same   to   the   Royal   Societ  //,   who   afterwards,   by   their   kind   en  couragement   and   entreaties,   engaged   me   to   think   of   publishing   them.   But  after   I   had   begun   to   consider   the   inequalities   of   the   lunar   motions,   and  had   entered   upon   some   other   things   relating   to   the   laws   and   measures   oi  gravity,   and   other   forces   :   and   the   figures   that   would   be   described   by   bodies  attracted   according   to   given   laws   ;   and   the   motion   of   several   bodies   moving  among   themselves;   the   motion   of   bodies   in   resisting   mediums;   the   forces,  densities,   and   motions,   of   rn(   Hums  ;   the   orbits   of   the   comets,   and   such   like  ;

Ixix  deferred   that   publication   till   I   had   made   a   searcli   into   those   matters,   and  could   put   forth   the   whole   together.   What   relates   to   the   lunar   motions   (be  ing   imperfect),   I   have   put   all   together   in   the   corollaries   of   Prop.   66,   to  avoid   being   obliged   to   propose   and   distinctly   demonstrate   the   several   things  there   contained   in   a   method   more   prolix   than   the   subject   deserved,   and   in  terrupt   the   series   of   the   several   propositions.   Some   things,   found   out   after  the   rest,   I   chose   to   insert   in   places   less   suitable,   rather   than   change   the  number   of   the   propositions   and   the   citations.   I   heartily   beg   that   what   1  have   here   done   may   be   read   with   candour;   and   that   the   defects   in   a  subject   so   difficult   be   not   so   much   reprehended   as   kindly   supplied,   and   in  vestigated   by   new   endeavours   of   mv   readers.  ISAAC   NEWTON.  Cambridge,   Trinity   Coupge     May   8,   In   the   second   edition   the   second   section   of   the   first   book   was   enlarged.  In   the   seventh   section   of   the   second   book   the   theory   of   the   resistances   of   fluids  was   more   accurately   investigated,   and   confirmed   by   new   experiments.   In  the   third   book   the   moon's   theory   and   the   profession   of   the   equinoxes   were  more   fully   deduced   from   their   principles  ;   and   the   theory   of   the   comets  was   confirmed   by   more   examples   of   the   calculati   >n   of   their   orbits,   done  also   with   greater   accuracy.  In   this   third   edition   the   resistance   of   mediums   is   somewhat   more   largely  handled   than   before;   and   new   experiments   of   the   resistance   of   heavy  bodies   falling   in   air   are   added.   In   the   third   book,   the   argument   to   prove  that   the   moon   is   retained   in   its   orbit   by   the   force   of   gravity   is   enlarged  on  ;   and   there   are   added   new   observations   of   Mr.   Pound's   of   the   proportion  of   the   diameters   of   Ju.piter   to   each   other  :   there   are,   besides,   added   Mr.  Kirk's   observations   of   the   comet   in   16SO  ;   the   orbit   of   that   comet   com  puted   in   an   ellipsis   by   Dr.   Halley  ;   and   the   ortit   of   the   comet   in  computed   by   Mr.   Bradley,

THE  MATHEMATICAL   PRINCIPLES  OF  NATURAL     PHILOSOPHY  DEFINITIONS.  DEFINITION   I.  77w?   quantity   of   matter   is   the   measure   of   the   same,   arising   from   its  density   and   hulk   conjutictly.  THUS   air   of   a   double   density,   in   a   double   space,   is   quadruple   in   quan-  ti   ty  ;   in   a   triple   space,   sextuple   in   quantity.   The   same   thing   is   to   be   un  derstood   of   snow,   and   fine   dust   or   powders,   that   are   condensed   by   compres  sion   or   liquefaction    "   and   of   all   bodies   that   are   by   any   causes   whatever  differently   condensed.   I   have   no   regard   in   this   place   to   a   medium,   if   any  such   there   is,   that   freely   pervades   the   interstices   between   the   parts   oi  bodies.   It   is   this   quantity   that   I   mean   hereafter   everywhere   under   the  name   of   body   or   mass.   And   the   same   is   known   by   the   weight   of   each  body  ;   for   it   is   proportional   to   the   weight,   as   I   have   found   by   experiments  on   pendulums,   very   accurately   made,   which   shall   be   shewn   hereafter.  DEFINITION   II.  The   quantity   of   motion   is   the   measure   nf   tlie   same,   arising   from   the  velocity   and   quantity   of   matter   corjunctly.  The   motion   of   the   whole   i<!   the   sum   of   the   motions   of   all   the   parts  ;   and  therefore   in   a   body   double   in   quantity,   with   equal   velocity,   the   motion   is  iouble  ;   with   twice   the   velocity,   it   is   quadruple,  DEFINITION   III.  The   vis   insita,   or   innate   force   of   matter,   is   a   power   of   resisting,   hy  which   every   body,   as   much   as   in   it   lies,   endeavours   to   persevere   in   its  present   stale,   whether   it   be   of   rest,   or   of   moving   uniformly   forward  in   a   right   line.  This   force   is   ever   proportional   to   the   body   whose   force   it   is  ;   and   differs  nothing   from   the   inactivity   of   the   mass,   but   in   our   manner   of   conceiving

T4   THE    MATHEMATICAL     PRINCIPLES  it.   A   body,   from   the   inactivity   of   matter,   is   not   without   difficulty   put   out  of   its   state   of   rest   or   motion.   Upon   which   account,   this   vis   insita,   may,  by   a   most   significant   name,   be   called   vis   inertia,   or   force   of   inactivity.  Hut   a   body   exerts   this   force   only,   when   another   force,   impressed   upon   it,  endeavours   to   change   its   condition  ;   and   the   exercise   of   this   force   may   bo  considered   both   as   resistance   and   impulse  ;   it   is   resistance,   in   so   far   as   the  body,   for   maintaining   its   present   state,   withstands   the   force   impressed;   it  is   impulse,   in   so   far   as   the   body,   by   not   easily   giving   way   to   the   impressed  force   of   another,   endeavours   to   change   the   state   of   that   other.   Resistance  is   usually   ascribed   to   bodies   at   rest,   and   impulse   to   those   in   motion;  but   motion   and   rest,   as   commonly   conceived,   are   only   relatively   distin  guished   ;   nor   are   those   bodies   always   truly   at   rest,   which   commonly   are  taken   to   be   so.  DKFLMTIOX   IV.  Ait   impressed   force   is   an   action   exerted   upon   a   body,   in   order   to   change  its   state,   either   of   rest,   or   of   moving   uniformly   forward   in   a   right  line.  This   force   consists   in   the   action   only;   and   remains   no   longer   in   the  body,   when   the   action   is   over.   For   a   body   maintains   every   new   state   it  acquires,   by   its   vis   inertice   only.   Impressed   forces   are   of   differe.it   origins    "  as   from   percussion,   from   pressure,   from   centripetal   force.  DEFINITION   V.  A   centripetal   force   is   that   by   which   bodies   are   drawn   or   impelled,   or   any  way   tend,   towards   a   point   as   to   a   centre.  Of   this   sort   is   gravity,   by   which   bodies   tend   to   the   centre   of   the   earth  magnetism,   by   which   iron   tends   to   the   loadstone  ;   and   that   force,   what  ever   it   is,   by   which   the   planets   are   perpetually   drawn   aside   from   the   rec  tilinear   motions,   which   otherwise   they   would   pursue,   and   made   to   revolve  in   curvilinear   orbits.   A   stone,   whirled   about   in   a   sling,   endeavours   to   re  cede   from   the   hand   that   turns   it  ;   and   by   that   endeavour,   distends   the  sling,   and   that   with   so   much   the   greater   force,   as   it   is   revolved   with   the  greater   velocity,   and   as   soon   as   ever   it   is   let   go,   flies   away.   That   force  which   opposes   itself   to   this   endeavour,   and   by   which   the   sling   perpetually  draws   back   the   stone   towards   the   hand,   and   retains   it   in   its   orbit,   because  it   is   directed   to   the   hand   as   the   centre   of   the   orbit,   I   call   the   centripetal  force.   And   the   same   thing   is   to   be   understood   of   all   bodies,   revolved   in  any   orbits.   They   all   endeavour   to   recede   from   the   centres   of   their   orbits  ;  and   wore   it   not   for   the   opposition   of   a   contrary   force   which   restrains   them  to,   and   detains   them   in   their   orbits,   which   I   therefore   call   centripetal,   would  tiy   off   in   right   lines,   with   an   uniform   motion.   A   projectile,   if   it   was   not  for   the   force   of   gravity,   would   not   deviate   towards   the   earth,   tut   would

OF     NATUJIAL     PHILOSOPHY.   7fl  go   off   from   it   in   a   right   line,   and   that   with   an   uniform   motion,,  if   the   re  sistance   of   the   air   was   taken   away.   It   is   by   its   gravity   that   it   is   drawn  aside   perpetually   from   its   rectilinear   course,   and   made   to   deviate   towards  the   earth,   more   or   less,   according   to   the   force   of   its   gravity,   and   the   velo  city   of   its   motion.   The   less   its   gravity   is,   for   the   quantity   of   its   matter,  or   the   greater   the   velocity   with   which   it   is   projected,   the   less   will   it   devi  ate   from   a   rectilinear   course,   and   the   farther   it   will   go.   If   a   leaden   balJ,  projected   from   the   top   of   a   mountain   by   the   force   of   gunpowder   with   a  given   velocity,   and   in   a   direction   parallel   to   the   horizon,   is   carried   in   a  curve   line   to   the   distance   of   two   miles   before   it   falls   to   the   ground   ;   the  same,   if   the   resistance   of   the   air   were   taken   away,   with   a   double   or   decuple  velocity,   would   fly   twice   or   ten   times   as   far.   And   by   increasing   the   velo  city,   we   may   at   pleasure   increase   the   distance   to   which   it   might   be   pro  jected,   and   diminish   the   curvature   of   the   line,   which   it   might   describe,   till  at   last   it   should   fall   at   the   distance   of   10,   30,   or   90   degrees,   or   even   might  go   quite   round   the   whole   earth   before   it   falls  ;   or   lastly,   so   that   it   might  never   fall   to   the   earth,   but   go   forward   into   the   celestial   spaces,   and   pro  ceed   in   its   motion   in   iiifiuitum.   And   after   the   same   manner   that   a   pro  jectile,   by   the   force   of   gravity,   may   be   made   to   revolve   in   an   orbit,   and   go  round   the   whole   earth,   the   moon   also,   either   by   the   force   of   gravity,   if   it  is   endued   with   gravity,   or   by   any   other   force,   that   impels   it   towards   the  earth,   may   be   perpetually   drawn   aside   towards   the   earth,   out   of   the   r&ti-  linear   way,   which   by   its   innate   force   it   would   pursue;   and   would   be   made  to   revolve   in   the   orbit   which   it   now   describes  ;   nor   could   the   moon   with  out   some   such   force,   be   retained   in   its   orbit.   If   this   force   was   too   small,  it   would   not   sufficiently   turn   the   moon   out   of   a   rectilinear   course  :   if   it  was   too   great,   it   would   turn   it   too   much,   arid   draw   down   the   moon   from  its   orbit   towards   the   earth.   It   is   necessary,   that   the   force   be   of   a   just  quantity,   and   it   belongs   to   the   mathematicians   to   find   the   force,   that   may  serve   exactly   to   retain   a   body   in   a   given   orbit,   with   a   given   velocity  ;   and  vice   versa,   to   determine   the   curvilinear   way,   into   which   a   body   projected  from   a   given   place,   with   a   given   velocity,   may   be   made   to   deviate   from  its   natural   rectilinear   way,   by   means   of   a   given   force.  The   quantity   of   any   centripetal   force   may   be   considered   as   of   three  kinds;   aboolu'e,   accelerative,   and   motive.  DEFINITION   VI.  The   absolute   quantity   of   a   centripetal   force   is   the   measure   f>f   the   same  proportional   to   the   efficacy   of   the   cause   that   propagates   it   from   the   cen  tre,   through   the   spaces   round   about.  Thus   the   magnetic   force   is   greater   in   one   load-stone   and   less   in   another  according   to   their   sizes   and   strength   of   intensity.

76   THE     MATHEMATICAL     PRINCIPLES  DEFINITION   VII.  The   accelerative   quantity   of   a   centripetal   force   is   the   measure,   of   tht  same,   proportional   to   the   velocity   which   it   generates   in   a   given   time.  Thus   the   force   of   the   same   load-stone   is   greater   at   a   less   distance,   and  less   at   a   greater  :   also   the   force   of   gravity   is   greater   in   valleys,   less   on  tops   of   exceeding   high   mountains  ;   and   yet   less   (as   shall   hereafter   be   shown),  at   greater   distances   from   the   body   of   the   earth  ;   but   at   equal   distan  ces,   it   is   the   same   everywhere  ;   because   (taking   away,   or   allowing   for,   the  resistance   of   the   air),   it   equally   accelerates   all   falling   bodies,   whether   heavy  or   light,   great   or   small.  DEFINITION   VIII.  TJie   motive   quantity   of   a   centripetal   force,   is   the   measure   of   the   samt\  proportional   to   the   motion   which   it   generates   in   a   given   twip.  Thus   the   weight   is   greater   in   a   greater   body,   less   in   a   less   body  ;   and.  in   the   same   body,   it   is   greater   near   to   the   earth,   and   less   at   remoter   dis  tances.   This   sort   of   quantity   is   the   centripetency,   or   propension   of   the  whole   body   towards   the   centre,   or,   as   I   may   say,   its   weight  ;   and   it   is   al  ways   known   by   the   quantity   of   an   equal   and   contrary   force   just   sufficient  to   Ifinder   the   descent   of   the   body.  These   quantities   of   forces,   we   may,   for   brevity's   sake,   call   by   the   names  of   motive,   accelerative,   and   absolute   forces  ;   and,   for   distinction's   sake,   con  sider   them,   with   respect   to   the   bodies   that   tend   to   the   centre  ;   to   the   places  of   those   bodies  ;   and   to   the   centre   of   force   towards   which   they   tend   ;   that  is   to   say,   I   refer   the   motive   force   to   the   body   as   an   endeavour   and   propen  sity   of   the   whole   towards   a   centre,   arising   from   the   propensities   of   the  several   parts   taken   together  ;   the   accelerative   force   to   the   place   of   the  body,   as   a   certain   power   or   energy   diffused   from   the   centre   to   all   places  around   to   move   the   bodies   that   are   in   them  :   and   the   absolute   force   to  the   centre,   as   endued   with   some   cause,   without   which   those   motive   forces  would   not   be   propagated   through   the   spaces   round   about  ;   whether   that  cause   be   some   central   body   (siuh   as   is   the   load-stone,   in   the   centre   of   the  magnetic   force,   or   the   earth   in   the   centre   of   the   gravitating   force),   or  anything   else   that   does   not   yet   appear.   For   I   here   design   only   to   give   a  mathematical   notion   of   those   forces,   without   considering   their   physical  causes   and   seats.  Wherefore   the   accelerative   force   will   stand   in   the   same   relation   to   the  motive,   as   celerity   does   to   motion.   For   the   quantity   of   motion   arises   from  the   celerity   drawn   into   the   quantity   of   matter  :   and   the   motive   force   arises  from   the   accelerative   force   drawn   into   the   same   quantity   of   matter.   For  the   sum   of   the   actions   of   the   accelerative   force,   upon   the   several   ;   articles  of   the   body,   is   the   motive   force   of   the   whole.   Hence   it   is,   that   near   the

OF     NATURAL     PHILOSOPHY.   77  surface   of   the   earth,   where   the   accelerative   gravity,   or   force   productive   of  gravity,   in   all   bodies   is   the   same,   the   motive   gravity   or   the   weight   is   as  the   body  :   but   if   we   should   ascend   to   higher   regions,   where   the   accelerative  gravity   is   less,   the   weight   would   be   equally   diminished,   and   would   always  be   as   the   product   of   the   body,   by   the   accelerative   gravity.   So   in   those   re  gions,   where   the   accelerative   gravity   is   diminished   into   one   half,   the   weight  of   a   body   two   or   three   times   less,   will   be   four   or   six   times   less.  I   likewise   call   attractions   and   impulses,   in   the   same   sense,   accelerative,  and   motive  ;   and   use   the   words   attraction,   impulse   or   propensity   of   any  sort   towards   a   centre,   promiscuously,   and   indifferently,   one   for   another  ;  considering   those   forces   not   physically,   but   mathematically   :   wherefore,   the  reader   is   not   to   imagine,   that   by   those   words,   I   anywhere   take   upon   me   to  define   the   kind,   or   the   manner   of   any   action,   the   causes   or   the   physical  reason   thereof,   or   that   I   attribute   forces,   in   a   true   and   physical   sense,   to  certain   centres   (which   are   only   mathematical   points)  ;   when   at   any   time   I  happen   to   speak   of   centres   as   attracting,   or   as   endued   with   attractive  powers.  SCHOLIUM.  Hitherto   I   have   laid   down   the   definitions   of   such   words   as   are   less  known,   and   explained   the   sense   in

   E  ;   whereas,   according   to   the  laws   of   mechanics,   the   matter   of   the   vortex   ought   to   move   more   swiftly   in  the   narrow   space   between   A   and   C   than   in   the   wide   space   between   D   and  F  ;   that   is,   more   swiftly   in   the   aphelion   than   in   the   perihelion.   Now   these  two   conclusions   contradict   each   other.   So   at   the   beginning   of   the   sign   of  Virgo,   where   the   aphelion   of   Mars   is   at   present,   the   distance   between   the*  orbits   of   Mars   and   Venus   is   to   the   distance   between   the   same   orbits,   at   the  beginning   of   the   sign   of   Pisces,   as   about   3   to   2  ;   and   therefore   the   matter  of   the   vortex   between   those   orbits   ought   to   be   swifter   at   the   beginning   of  Pisces   than   at   the   beginning   of   Virgo   in   the   ratio   of   3   to   2   ;   for   the   nar  rower   the   space   is   through   which   the   same   quantity   of   matter   passes   in   the  same   time   of   one   revolution,   the   greater   will   be   the   velocity   with   which   it  passes   through   it.   Therefore   if   the   earth   being   relatively   at   rest   in   this  celestial   matter   should   be   carried   round   by   it,   and   revolve   together   with   it  about   the   sun,   the   velocity   of   the   earth   at   the   beginning   of   Pisces  would   be   to   its   velocity   at   the   beginning   of   Virgo   in   a   sesquialteral   ratio.  Therefore   the   sun's   apparent   diurnal   motion   at   the   beginning   of   Virgo  ought   to   be   above   70   minutes,   and   at   the   beginning   of   Pisces   less   than   48  minutes;   whereas,   on   the   contrary,   that   apparent   motion   of   the   sun   is  really   greater   at   the   beginning   of   Pisces   than   at   the   beginning   of   Virgo;  as   experience   testifies   ;   and   therefore   the   earth   is   swifter   at   the   beginning  of   Virgo   than   at   the   beginning   of   Pisces  ;   so   that   the   hypothesis   of   vor  tices   is   utterly   irreconcileable   with   astronomical   phenomena,   and   rather  serves   to   perplex   than   explain   the   heavenly   motions.   How   these   mo  tions   are   performed   in   free   spaces   without   vortices,   may   be   understood  by   the   first   Book   j   and   I   shall   now   more   fully   treat   of   it   in   the   following  Book.

BOOK   III.  IN   the   preceding   Books   I   have   laid   down   the   principles   of   philosophy  ,  principles   not   philosophical,   but   mathematical  :   such,   to   wit,   as   we   may  build   our   reasonings   upon   in   philosophical   inquiries.   These   principles   are  the   laws   and   conditions   of   certain   motions,   and   powers   or   forces,   which  chiefly   have   respect   to   philosophy  :   but,   lest   they   should   have   appeared   of  themselves   dry   and   barren,   I   have   illustrated   them   here   and   there   with  some   philosophical   scholiums,   giving   an   account   of   such   things   as   are   of  more   general   nature,   and   which   philosophy   seems   chiefly   to   be   founded   on   ;  such   as   the   density   and   the   resistance   of   bodies,   spaces   void   of   all   bodies,  and   the   motion   of   light   and   sounds.   It   remains   that,   from   the   same   prin  ciples,   I   now   demonstrate   the   frame   of   the   System   of   the   World.   Upon  this   subject   I   had,   indeed,   composed   the   third   Book   in   a   popular   method,  that   it   might   be   read   by   many  ;   but   afterward,   considering   that   such   as  had   not   sufficiently   entered   into   the   principles   could   not   easily   discern   the  strength   of   the   consequences,   nor   lay   aside   the   prejudices   to   which   they   had  been   many   years   accustomed,   therefore,   to   prevent   the   disputes   which   might  be   raised   upon   such   accounts,   I   chose   to   reduce   the   substance   of   this   Book  into   the   form   of   Propositions   (in   the   mathematical   way),   which   should   be  read   by   those   only   who   had   first   made   themselves   masters   of   the   principles  established   in   the   preceding   Books  :   not   that   I   would   advise   any   one   to   the  previous   study   of   every   Proposition   of   those   Books  ;   for   they   abound   with  such   as   might   cost   too   much   time,   even   to   readers   of   good   mathematical  learning.   It   is   enough   if   one   carefully   reads   the   Definitions,   the   Laws   of  Motion,   and   the   first   three   Sections   of   the   first   Book.   He   may   then   pass  on   to   this   Book,   and   consult   such   of   the   remaining   Propositions   of   the  first   two   Books,   as   the   references   in   this,   and   his   occasions,   shall   require.

384   THE     MATHEMATICAL     PRINCIPLES   [BOOK     III.  RULES   OF   REASONING   IN   PHILOSOPHY,  RULE   I.  We   are   I'o   admit   no   more   causes   of   natural   things   than   such   as   are   both  true   and   sufficient   to   explain   their   appearances.  To   this   purpose   the   philosophers   say   that   Nature   does   nothing   in   vain,  and   more   is   in   vain   when   less   will   serve  ;   for   Nature   is   pleased   with   sim  plicity,   and   affects   not   the   pomp   of   superfluous   causes.  RULE   II.  Therefore   to   the   same   natural   effects   we   must,   as   far   as   possible,   assign  the   same   causes.  As   to   respiration   in   a   man   and   in   a   beast;   the   descent   of   stones   in   Europe  and   in   America   ;   the   light   of   our   culinary   fire   and   of   the   sun  ;   the   reflec  tion   of   light   in   the   earth,   and   in   the   planets.  RULE   III.  The   qualities   of   bodies,   which   admit   neither   intension   nor   remission   oj  degrees,   and   which   are   found   to   belong   to   all   bodies   within   the   reach  of   our   experiments,   are   to   be   esteemed   the   universal   qualities   of   all  bodies   whatsoever.  For   since   the   qualities   of   bodies   are   only   known   to   us   by   experiments,   we  are   to   hold   for   universal   all   such   as   universally   agree   with   experiments   ;  nnd   such   as   are   not   liable   to   diminution   can   never   be   quite   taken   away.  We   are   certainly   not   to   relinquish   the   evidence   of   experiments   for   the   sake  of   dreams   and   vain   fictions   of   our   own   devising  ;   nor   are   we   to   recede   from  the   analogy   of   Nature,   which   uses   to   be   simple,   and   always   consonant   to  itself.   We   no   other   way   know   the   extension   of   bodies   than   by   our   senses,  nor   do   these   reach   it   in   all   bodies;   but   because   we   perceive   extension   in  all   that   are   sensible,   therefore   we   ascribe   it   universally   to   all   others   also.  That   abundance   of   bodies   are   hard,   we   learn   by   experience  ;   and   because  the   hardness   of   the   whole   arises   from   the   hardness   of   the   parts,   we   therefore  justly   infer   the   hardness   of   the   undivided   particles   not   only   of   the   bodies  we   feel   but   of   all   others.   That   all   bodies   are   impenetrable,   we   gather   not  from   reason,   but   from   sensation.   The   bodies   which   we   handle   we   find   im  penetrable,   and   thence   conclude   impenetrability   to   be   an   universal   property  of   all   bodies   whatsoever.   That   all   bodies   are   rnoveable,   and   endowed   with  certain   powers   (which   we   call   the   vires   inertias]   of   persevering   in   their   mo  tion,   or   in   their   rest,   we   only   infer   from   the   like   properties   observed   in   the

BOOK     1II.J   OF     NATURAL     PHILOSOPHY.   385  bodies   which   we   have   seen.   The   extension,   hardness,   impenetrability,   mo  bility,   and   vis   inertia   of   the   whole,   result   from   the   extension,   hardness,  impenetrability,   mobility,   and   vires   inertia   of   the   parts;   and   thence   we  conclude   the   least   particles   of   all   bodies   to   be   also   all   extended,   and   hard  and   impenetrable,   and   moveable,   and   endowed   with   their   proper   vires   inertia.  And   this   is   the   foundation   of   all   philosophy.   Moreover,   that   the   divided  but   contiguous   particles   of   bodies   may   be   separated   from   one   another,   is  matter   of   observation  ;   and,   in   the   particles   that   remain   undivided,   our  minds   are   able   to   distinguish   yet   lesser   parts,   as   is   mathematically   demon  strated.   But   whether   the   parts   so   distinguished,   and   not   yet   divided,   may,  by   the   powers   of   Nature,   be   actually   divided   and   separated   from   one   an  other,   we   cannot   certainly   determine.   Yet,   had   we   the   proof   of   but   one  experiment   that   any   undivided   particle,   in   breaking   a   hard   and   solid   body,  suffered   a   division,   we   might   by   virtue   of   this   rule   conclude   that   the   un  divided   as   well   as   the   divided   particles   may   be   divided   and   actually   sep  arated   to   infinity.  Lastly,   if   it   universally   appears,   by   experiments   and   astronomical   obser  vations,   that   all   bodies   about   the   earth   gravitate   towards   the   earth,   and  that   in   proportion   to   the   quantity   of   matter   which   they   severally   contain  ;  that   the   moon   likewise,   according   to   the   quantity   of   its   matter,   gravitates  towards   the   earth  ;   that,   on   the   other   hand,   our   sea   gravitates   towards   the  moon  ;   and   all   the   planets   mutually   one   towards   another  ;   and   the   comets  in   like   manner   towards   the   sun   ;   we   must,   in   consequence   of   this   rule,   uni  versally   allow   that   all   bodies   whatsoever   are   endowed   with   a   principle   ot  mutual   gravitation.   For   the   argument   from   the   appearances   concludes   with  more   force   for   the   universal   gravitation   of   all   bodies   than   for   their   impen  etrability   ;   of   which,   among   those   in   the   celestial   regions,   we   have   no   ex  periments,   nor   any   manner   of   observation.   Not   that   I   affirm   gravity   to   be  essential   to   bodies   :   by   their   vis   insita   I   mean   nothing   but   their   vis   iiicrticz.  This   is   immutable.   Their   gravity   is   diminished   as   they   recede   from   the  earth.  RULE   IV.  In   experimental   philosophy   we   are   to   look   upon   propositions   collected   by  general   induction   from,   phenomena   as   accurately   or   very   nearly   true,  notwithstanding   any   contrary   hypotheses   that   may   be   imagined,   till  such   time   as   other   phenomena   occur,   by   which   they   may   either   be   made  more   accurate,   or   liable   to   exceptions.  This   rule   we   must   follow,   that   the   argument   of   induction   may   not   bf  evaded   by   hypotheses.  25

The   greatest   heliocentric   elongation   of   the   fourth   satellite   from  Tupiter's   centre   was   taken   with   a   micrometer   in   a   15   feet   telescope,   and   at  the   mean   distance   of   Jupiter   from   the   earth   was   found   about   8'   16".   The  elongation   of   the   third   satellite   was   taken   with   a   micrometer   in   a   telescope  of   123   feet,   and   at   the   same   distance   of   Jupiter   from   the   earth   was   found  4'   42".   The   greatest   elongations   of   the   other   satellites,   at   the   same   dis  tance   of   Jupiter   from   the   earth,   are   found   from   the   periodic   times   to   be   2'  56"   47'",   and   1'   51"   6'".  The   diameter   of   Jupiter   taken   with   the   micrometer   in   a   123   feet   tele  scope   several   times,   and   reduced   to   Jupiter's   mean   distance   from   the   earth,  proved   always   less   than   40",   never   less   than   38",   generally   39".   This   di  ameter   in   shorter   telescopes   is   40",   or   41";   for   Jupiter's   light   is   a   little  dilated   by   the   unequal   refrangibility   of   the   rays,'   and   this   dilatation   bears  3   less   ratio   to   the   diameter   of   Jupiter   in   the   longer   and   more   perfect   tele-  escopes   than   in   those   which   are   shorter   and   less   perfect.

And   from   the   transit   of   the   first   satellite,   the   diameter   of   Jupiter  at   its   mean   distance   from   the   earth   came   forth   37  J-".   and   from   the   transit  of   the   third   371".

Let   us  suppose   its   diameter   to   be   37}"   very   nearly,   and   then   the   greatest   elonga  tions   of   the   first,   second,   third,   and   fourth   satellite   will   be   respectively  equal   to   5,965,   9,494,   15,141,   and   26,63   semi-diameters   of   Jupiter.

The   greatest   elongation   of   the   fourth   satellite   from   Saturn's   centre   is  commonly   determined   from   the   observations   to   be   eight   of   semi-  diameters   very   nearly.   But   the   greatest   elongation   of   this   satellite   from  Saturn's   centre,   when   taken   with   an   excellent   micrometer   iuMr../fuyg'en8>  telescope   of   123   feet,   appeared   to   be   eight   semi-diameters   and   T7-0   of   a   semi-  diameter.   And   from   this   observation   arid   the   periodic   times   the   distances  of   the   satellites   from   Saturn's   centre   in   serni-diameters   of   the   ring   are   2.1.  2,69.   3,75.   8,7.   and   25,35.   The   diameter   of   Saturn   observed   in   the   same  telescope   was   found   to   be   to   the   diameter   of   the   ring   as   3   to   7  ;   and   the  diameter   of   the   ring,   May   28-29,   1719,   was   found   to   be   43"  ;   and   th:*nce  the   diameter   of   the   ring   when   Saturn   is   at   its   mean   distance   from   the  earth   is   42",   and   the   diameter   of   Saturn   18".   These   things   appear   so   in  very   long   and   excellent   telescopes,   because   in   such   telescopes   the   apparent  magnitudes   of   the   heavenly   bodies   bear   a   greater   proportion   to   the   dilata  tion   of   light   in   the   extremities   of   those   bodies   than   in   shorter   telescopes.

PHENOMENON   III.  0  That   the   five   primary   planets,   Mercury,   Venus,   Mars,   Jupiter,   and   Sat  urn,   with   their   several   orbits,   encompass   the   sun.  That   Mercury   and   Venus   revolve   about   the   sun,   is   evident   from   their  moon-like   appearances.   When   they   shine   out   with   a   full   face,   they   are,   in  respect   of   us,   beyond   or   above   the   sun  ;   when   they   appear   half   full,   they  are   about   the   same   height   on   one   side   or   other   of   the   sun  ;   when   horned,  they   are   below   or   between   us   and   the   sun  ;   and   they   are   sometimes,   when  directly   under,   seen   like   spots   traversing   the   sun's   disk.   That   Mars   sur  rounds   the   sun,   is   as   plain   from   its   full   face   when   near   its   conjunction   with  the   sun.   and   from   the   gibbous   figure   which   it   shews   in   its   quadratures.
