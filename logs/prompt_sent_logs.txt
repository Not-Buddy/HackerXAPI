amation,  on  perceiving  his  loss,
was,  "  Oh  Diamond,  Diamond,  little  knowest  thou  the  mischiel
thou  hast  done,"  Dr.  Brewster,  in  his  life  of  our  author,  gives  the
following  extract  from  the  manuscript  Diary  of  Mr.  Abraham  De
La  Pryme.  a  student  in  the  University  at  the  time  of  this  oc
currence.
"  1692.  February,  3. — What  I  heard  to-day  I  must  relate.
There  is  one  Mr.  Newton  (whom  I  have  very  oft  seen),  Fellow
of  Trinity  College,  that  is  mighty  famous  for  his  learning,  being  a
most  excellent  mathematician,  philosopher,  divine,  &c.  He  has
been  Fellow  of  the  Royal  Society  these  many  years  ;  and  among
other  very  learned  books  and  tracts,  he:s  written  one  upon  the  mathe
matical  principles  of  philosophy,  which  has  given  him  a  mighty
name,  he  having  received,  especially  from  Scotland,  abundance  of
congratulatory  letters  for  the  same  ;  but  of  all  the  books  he  ever
wrote,  there  was  one  of  colours  and  light,  established  upon  thou
sands  of  experiments  which  he  had  been  twenty  years  of  making,
and  which  had  cost  him  many  hundreds  of  pounds.  This  book
which  he  vaiued  so  much,  and  which  was  so  much  talked  of,  had
the  ill  luck  to  perish,  and  be  utterly  lost  just  when  the  learned
author  was  almost  at  pitting  a  conclusion  at  the  same,  after  this
manner  :  In  a  winter's  morning,  leaving  it  among  his  other  papers
on  his  study  table  while  he  went  to  chapel,  the  candle,  which  he
had  unfortunately  left  burning  there,  too,  catched  hold  by  some
means  of  other  papers,  and  they  fired  the  aforesaid  book,  and  ut
terly  consumed  it  and  several  other  valuable  writings  ;  arid  which
is  most  wonderful  did  no  further  mischief.  But  when  Mr.  New
ton  came  from  chapel,  and  had  seen  what  was  done,  every  one
thought  he  would  have  run  mad,  he  was  so  troubled  thereat  that
he  was  not  himself  for  a  month  after.  A  long  account  of  this  his
system  of  colours  you  may  find  in  the  Transactions  of  the  Royal
Society,  which  he  had  sent  up  to  them  long  before  this  sad  mis
chance  happened  unto  him."
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   43
It  will  be  borne  in  mind  that  all  of  Newton's  theological  wri
tings,  with  the  exception  of  the  Letters  to  Dr.  Bentley,  were
composed  before  this  event  which,  we  must  conclude,  from
Pryme's  words,  produced  a  serious  impression  upon  our  author  for
about  a  month.  But  M.  Biot,  in  his  Life  of  Newton,  relying  on  a
memorandum  contained  in  a  small  manuscript  Journal  of  Huygens,
declares  this  occurrence  to  have  caused  a  deran-gement  of  New
ton's  intellect.  M.  Blot's  opinions  and  deductions,  however,  as
well  as  those  of  La  Place,  upon  this  subject,  were  based  upon
erroneous  data,  and  have  been  overthrown  by  the  clearest  proof.
There  is  not,  in  fact,  the  least  evidence  that  Newton's  reason  was,
for  a  single  moment,  dethroned  ;  on  the  contrary,  the  testimony
is  conclusive  that  he  was,  at  all  times,  perfectly  capable  of  carry
ing  on  his  mathematical,  metaphysical  and  astronomical  inquiries.
Loss  of  sleep,  loss  of  appetite,  and  irritated  nerves  will  disturb
somewhat  the  equanimity  of  the  most  serene  ;  and  an  act  done,  or
language  employed,  under  such  temporary  discomposure,  is  not  a
just  criterion  of  the  general  tone  and  strength  of  a  man's  mind.
As  to  the  accident  itself,  we  may  suppose,  whatever  might  have
been  its  precise  nature,  that  it  greatly  distressed  him,  and,  still
further,  that  its  shock  may  have  originated  the  train  of  nervous
derangements,  which  afflicted  him,  more  or  less,  for  two  years
afterward.  Yet,  during  this  very  period  of  ill  health,  we  find  him
putting  forth  his  highest  powers.  In  1692,  he  prepared  for,  and
transmitted  to  Dr.  Wallis  the  first  proposition  of  the  Treatise  on
Quadratures,  with  examples  of  it  in  first,  second  and  third  flux
ions.  He  investigated,  in  the  same  year,  the  subject  of  haloes  ;
making  and  recording  numerous  and  important  observations  rela
tive  thereto.  Those  profound  and  beautiful  Letters  to  Dr.  Bentley
were  written  at  the  close  of  this  and  the  beginning  of  the  next
year.  In  October,  1693,  Locke,  who  was  then  about  publishing  a
second  edition  of  his  work  on  the  Human  Understanding,  request
ed  Newton  to  reconsider  his  opinions  on  innate  ideas.  And  in
1694,  he  was  zealously  occupied  in  perfecting  his  lunar  theory  ;
visiting  Flamstead,  at  the  Royal  Observatory  of  Greenwich,  in
September,  and  obtaining  a  series  of  lunar  observations  ;  and
14   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
commencing,  in  October,  a  correspondence  with  that  distinguished
practical  Astronomer,  which  continued  till  1698.
We  now  arrive  at  the  period  when  Newton  permanently  with
drew  from  the  seclusion  of  a  collegiate,  and  entered  upon  a  more
active  and  public  life.  He  was  appointed  Warden  of  the  Mint,
in  1695,  through  the  influence  of  Charles  Montague,  Chancellor
of  the  Exchequer,  and  afterward  Earl  of  Halifax.  The  current
roin  of  the  nation  had  been  adulterated  and  debased,  and  Mon
tague  undertook  a  re-coinage.  Our  author's  mathematical  and
chemical  knowledge  proved  eminently  useful  in  accomplishing
this  difficult  and  most  salutary  reform.  In  1699,  he  was  pro
moted  to  the  Mastership  of  the  Mint — an  office  worth  twelve  or
fifteen  hundred  pounds  per  annum,  and  which  he  held  during  the
remainder  of  his  life.  He  wrote,  in  this  capacity,  an  official  Re
port  on  the  Coinage,  which  has  been  published  ;  he  also  prepared
a  Table  of  Assays  of  Foreign  Coins,  which  was  printed  at  the
end  of  Dr.  Arbuthnot's  Tables  of  Ancient  Coins,  Weights,  and
Measures,  in  1727.
Newton  retained  his  Professorship  at  Cambridge  till  1703.
But  he  had,  on  receiving  the  appointment  of  Master  of  the  Mint,
in  1699,  made  Mr.  Whiston  his  deputy,  with  all  the  emoluments
of  the  office  ;  and,  on  finally  resigning,  procured  his  nomination  to
the  vacant  Chair.
In  January  1697,  John  Bernouilli  proposed  to  the  most  distin
guished  mathematicians  of  Europe  two  problems  for  solution.
Leibnitz,  admiring  the  beauty  of  one  of  them,  requested  the  time
for  solving  it  to  be  extended  to  twelve  months — twice  the  period
originally  named.  The  delay  was  readily  granted.  Newton,  how
ever,  sent  in,  the  day  after  he  received  the  problems,  a  solution  of
them  to  the  President  of  the  Royal  Society.  Bernouilli  obtained
solutions  from  Newton,  Leibinitz  and  the  Marquis  De  L'Hopital  ;
but  Newton's  though  anonymous,  he  immediately  recognised
" tanquam  ungue  leonem"  as  the  lion  is  known  by  his  claw.
We  may  mention  here  the  famous  problem  of  the  trajectories
proposed  by  Leibnitz,  in  1716,  for  the  purpose  of  "feeling  the
pulse  of  the  English  Analysts."  Newton  received  the  problem
about  five  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  as  he  was  returning  from  the
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   45
Mint  ;  and  though  it  was  extremely  difficult  and  he  himself  much
fatigued,  yet  he  completed  its  solution,  the  same  evening  before
he  went  to  bed.
The  history  of  these  problems  affords,  by  direct  comparison,  a
striking  illustration  of  Newton's  vast  superiority  of  mind.  That
amazing  concentration  and  grasp  of  intellect,  of  which  we  have
spoken,  enabled  him  to  master  speedily,  and,  as  it  were,  by  a
single  effort,  those  things,  for  the  achievement  of  which,  the  many
would  essay  utterly  in  vain,  and  the  very,  very  few  attain  only
after  long  and  renewed  striving.  And  yet,  with  a  modesty  as
unparalleled  as  his  power,  he  attributed  his  successes,  not  to  any
extraordinary  sagacity,  but  solely  to  industry  and  patient  thought.
Mr-  kept  the  subject  of  consideration  constantly  before  him,  and
waited  till  the  first  dawning  opened  gradually  into  a  full  and
clear  light ;  never  quitting,  if  possible,  the  mental  process  till  the
object  of  it  were  wholly  gained.  He  never  allowed  this  habit  of
meditation  to  appear  in  his  intercourse  with  society ;  but  in  the
privacy  of  his  own  chamber,  or  in  the  midst  of  his  own  family,  he
gave  himself  up  to  the  deepest  abstraction.  Occupied  with  some
interesting  investigation,  he  would  often  sit  down  on  his  bedside,
after  he  rose,  and  remain  there,  for  hours,  partially  dressed.
Meal-time  would  frequently  come  and  pass  unheeded  ;  so  that,
unless  urgently  reminded,  he  would  neglect  to  take  the  re
quisite  quantity  of  nourishment.  But  notwithstanding  his  anx
iety  to  be  left  undisturbed,  he  would,  when  occasion  required,
turn  aside  his  thoughts,  though  bent  upon  the  most  intricate  re
search,  and  then,  when  leisure  served,  again  direct  them  to  the
very  point  where  they  ceased  to  act  :  and  this  he  seemed  to  ac
complish  not  so  much  by  the  force  of  his  memory,  as  by  the  force
of  his  inventive  faculty,  before  the  vigorous  intensity  of  which,  no
subject,  however  abstruse,  remained  long  unexplored.
Me  was  elected  a  member  of  the  Royal  Academy  of  Sciences
at  Paris,  in  1699,  when  that  distinguished  Body  were  empowered,
by  a  new  charter,  to  admit  a  small  number  of  foreign  associates.
In  1700,  he  communicated  to  Dr.  Halley  a  description  of  his  re
flecting  instrument  for  observing  the  moon's  distance  from  the
fixed  stars.  This  description  was  published  in  the  Philosophical
46   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,
Transactions,  in  1742.  The  instrument  was  the  same  as  that
produced  by  Mr.  Hadley,  in  1731,  and  which,  under  the  name  of
Hadley's  Quadrant,  has  been  of  so  great  use  in  navigation.  On
the  assembling  of  the  new  Parliament,  in  1701,  Newton  was  re-
elected  one  of  the  members  for  the  University  of  Cambridge.  In
1703,  he  was  chosen  President  of  the  Royal  Society  of  London,
to  which  office  he  was  annually  re-elected  till  the  period  of  his
decease — about  twenty-five  years  afterward.
Our  author  unquestionably  devoted  more  labour  to,  and,  in
many  respects,  took  a  greater  pride  in  his  Optical,  than  his  other
discoveries.  This  science  he  had  placed  on  a  new  and  indestruc
tible  basis  ;  and  he  wished  not  only  to  build,  but  to  perfect  the
costly  and  glowing  structure.  He  had  communicated,  before  the
publication  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  his  most  important  researches  on
light  to  the  Royal  Society,  in  detached  papers  which  were  inserted
in  successive  numbers  of  the  Transactions  ;  but  he  did  not  pub
lish  a  connected  view  of  these  labours  till  1704,  when  they  appeared
under  the  title  of  OPTICS  :  OR,  A  TREATISE  ON  THE  REFLEXIONS,
REFRACTIONS,  INFLEXIONS  AND  COLOURS  OF  LIGHT.  To  this,
but  to  no  subsequent  edition,  were  added  two  Mathematical  Trea
tises,  entitled,  TRACTATUS  DUO  DE  SPECIEBUS  ET  MAGNITUDINE
FIGURARUM  cuRViLiNEARUM  ;  the  one  bearing  the  title  TRACTATUS
DE  QUADRATURA  CuRVARUM  ;  and  the  other,  that  of  ENUMERATIO
LINEARUM  TERTII  ORDiNis.  The  publication  of  these  Mathemati
cal  Treatises  was  made  necessary  in  consequence  of  plagiarisms
from  the  manuscripts  of  them  loaned  by  the  author  to  his  friends.
Dr.  Samuel  Clarke  published  a  Latin  translation  of  the  Optics,  in
in  1706  ;  whereupon  he  was  presented  by  Newton,  as  a  mark  of
his  grateful  approbation,  with  five  hundred  pounds,  or  one  hun
dred  pounds  for  each  of  his  children.  The  work  was  afterward
translated  into  French.  It  had  a  remarkably  wide  circulation,
and  appeared,  in  several  successive  editions,  both  in  England  and
on  the  Continent.  There  is  displayed,  particularly  on  this  Opti
cal  Treatise,  the  author's  talent  for  simplifying  and  communica
ting  the  profoundest  speculations.  It  is  a  faculty  rarely  united  to
that  of  the  highest  invention.  Newton  possessed  both  ;  and  thus
that  mental  perfectness  which  enabled  him  to  create,  to  combine,
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   47
and  to  teach,  and  so  render  himself,  not  the  "ornament"  cnly;
but  inconceivably  more,  the  pre-eminent  benefactor  of  his  species.
The  honour  of  knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre
sentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority.
It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min
isters  and  electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity
of  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc
casion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced
clothes.
The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years,
delivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707,
under  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI
TIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication
is  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part.  Mr.
Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ;
and  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was
issued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr.  Machin.  Subsequent  editions,
both  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
fessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge.  The  first  edition  had  been
sold  off  for  some  time.  Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very
rare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original
cost.  A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally
appeared  in  May,  1713.  It  had  many  alterations  and  improve
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the
pen  of  Cotes.
Our  author's  early  Treatise,  entitled,  ANALYSIS  PER  EQUATIONES
NUMERO  TERMINORUM  INFINITAS,  as  well  as  a  small  Tract,  Gearing
the  title  of  METHODUS  DIFFERENTIALS,  was  published,  witn  nis
consent,  in  1711.  The'  former  of  these,  and  the  Treatise  De
Quadratura  Curvarum,  translated  into  Englisn,  witn  a  .arge  com
mentary,  appeared  in  1745.  His  work,  entitled.  ARTIS  ANA
LYTICS  SPECIMINA,  VEL  GEOMETRIA  ANALYTICA,  was  iirs;  given
to  the  world  in  the  edition  of  Dr.  Horsley,  1779.
48   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun*
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances,
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
sion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel
with  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always
preserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter
worthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him.
Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as
bearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate.
For  an  early  publication,  especially  in  the  case  of  his  Method  of
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all  rivalry,  and  secured  him
from  the  contentious  claims  of  Leibnitz.  Still  each  one  will  solve
the  problem  of  his  existence  in  his  own  way,  and,  with  a  manlike
Newton,  his  own,  as  we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the  best
way.  The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable
with  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man  ;  giant-like,  and  doing
nobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the
dimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.  Opening
in  1699,  the  discussion  in  question  continued  till  the  close  of
Leibnitz's  life,  in  1716.  We  give  the  summary  of  the  case  as
contained  in  the  Report  of  the  Committee  of  the  Royal  Society,
the  deliberately  weighed  opinion  of  which  has  been  adopted  as  an
authoritative  decision  in  all  countries.
"  We  have  consulted  the  letters  and  letter  books  in  the  custody
of  the  Royal  Society,  and  those  found  among  the  papers  of  Mr.
John  Collins,  dated  between  the  years  1669  and  1677,  inclusive  ;
and  showed  them  to  such  as  knew  and  avouched  the  hands  of  Mr.
Barrow,  Mr.  Collins,  Mr.  Oldenburg,  and  Mr.  Leibnitz  ;  and
compared  those  of  Mr.  Gregory  with  one  another,  and  with  copies
of  some  of  them  taken  in  the  hand  of  Mr.  Collins  ;  and  have
extracted  from  them  what  relates  to  the  matter  referred  to  us  :
all  which  extracts,  herewith  delivered  to  you,  we  believe  to  be
genuine  and  authentic.  And  by  these  letters  and  papers  wf

"  I.  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  in  London  in  the  beginning  of  the  year
1673  ;  and  went  thence  in  or  about  March,  to  Paris,  where  he
kept  a  correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins,  by  means  of  Mr.  Olden
burg,  till  about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned,  by  London
and  Amsterdam,  to  Hanover:  and  that  Mr.  Collins  was  very  free
in  communicating  to  able  mathematicians  what  he  had  received
from  Mr,  Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory.
"  II.  That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London,
he  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method,
properly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr.
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
June,  1677,  which  was  a  year  after  a  copy  of  Mr.  Newton's  letter
of  the  10th  of  December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to  Paris  to  be
communicated  to  him  ;  and  above  four  years  after  Mr.  Collins
began  to  communicate  that  letter  to  his  correspondents  ;  in  which
letter  the  method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any
intelligent  person.
"III.  That  by  Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of  the  13th  of  June,  1676
it  appears  that  he  had  the  method  of  fluxions  above  five  years
before  the  writing  of  that  letter.  And  by  his  Analysis  per  ^Equa-
tiones  numero  Terminorum  Infmitas,  communicated  by  Dr.  Barrow
to  Mr.  Collins,  in  July,  1669,  we  find  that  he  had  invented  the
method  before  that  time.
"IV.  That  the  differential  method  is  one  and  the  same  with
the  method  of  fluxions,  excepting  the  name  and  mode  of  notation  ;
Mr.  Leibnitz  calling  those  quantities  differences  which  Mr.  Newton
calls  moments,  or  fluxions  ;  and  marking  them  with  a  letter  d — a
mark  not  used  by  Mr.  Newton.
"  And,  therefore,  we  take  the  proper  question  to  be,  not  who
invented  this  or  that  method,  but,  who  was  the  first  inventor  of
the  method  ?  And  we  believe  that  those  who  have  reputed  Mr.
Leibnitz  the  first  inventor  knew  little  or  nothing  of  his  correspond
ence  with  Mr.  Collins  and  Mr.  Oldenburg  long  before,  nor  of  Mr.
50   LIFE    OP    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
Newton's  hiving  that   method   above   fifteen  years  before   Mr
Leibnitz  began  to  publish  it  in  the  Acta  Eruditorum  of  Leipsic.
"  For  which  reason  we  reckon  Mr.  Newton  the  first  inventor  ;
and  are  of  opinion  that  Mr.  Keill,  in  asserting  the  same,  has  been
no  ways  injurious  to  Mr.  Leibnitz.  And  we  submit  to  the  judg
ment  of  the  Society,  whether  the  extract  and  papers,  now  pre
sented  to  you,  together  with  what  is  extant,  to  the  same  pur
pose,  in  Dr.  Wallis's  third  volume,  may  not  deserve  to  be  made
public." This  Report,  with  the  collection  of  letters  and  manuscripts,
under  the  title  of  COMMERCIUM  EPISTOLICUM  D.  JOHANNIS  COLLINS
ET     ALIORUM     DE    ANALYSI    PROMOTA     JuSSU     SoCIETATIS     REGIES
EDITUM,  appeared  accordingly  in  the  early  part  of  1713.  Its
publication  seemed  to  infuse  additional  bitterness  into  the  feelings
of  Leibnitz,  who  descended  to  unfounded  charges  and  empty
threats.  He  had  been  privy  counsellor  to  the  Elector  of  Han
over,  before  that  prince  was  elevated  to  the  British  throne  ;  and
in  his  correspondence,  in  1715  and  1716,  with  the  Abbe  Conti,
then  at  the  court  of  George  L,  and  with  Caroline,  Princess  of
Wales,  he  attacked  the  doctrines  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  indirectly
its  author,  in  a  manner  very  discreditable  to  himself,  both  as  a
learned  and  as  an  honourable  man.  His  assaults,  however,  were
triumphantly  met;  and,  to  the  complete  overthrow  of  his  rival
pretensions,  Newton  was  induced  to  give  the  finishing  blow.  The
verdict  is  universal  and  irreversible  that  the  English  preceded
the  German  philosopher,  by  at  least  ten  years,  in  the  invention
of  fluxions.  Newton  could  not  have  borrowed  from  Leibnitz  ;
but  Leibnitz  might  have  borrowed  from  Newton.  A  new  edition
of  the  Commercium  Epistolicum  was  published  in  1722-5  (?)  ;  but
neither  in  this,  nor  in  the  former  edition,  did  our  author  take  any
part.  The  disciples,  enthusiastic,  capable  and  ready,  effectually
shielded,  with  the  buckler  of  Truth,  the  character  of  the  Master,
whose  own  conduct  throughout  was  replete  with  delicacy,  dignity
and  justice.  He  kept  aloof  from  the  controversy — in  which  Dr.
Keill  stood  forth  as  the  chief  representative  of  the  Newtonian
side — till  the  very  last,  when,  for  the  satisfaction  of  the  King,
George  L.  rather  than  for  his  own,  he  consented  to  put  forth  his

hand  and  firmly  secure  his  rights  upon  a  certain  and  impregnable,
basis.
A  petition  to  have  inventions  for  promoting  the  discovery  of  the
longitude  at  sea,  suitably  rewarded,  was  presented  to  the  House
of  Commons,  in  1714.  A  committee,  having  been  appointed  to
investigate  the  subject,  called  upon  Newton  and  others  for  their
opinions.  That  of  our  author  was  given  in  writing,  A  report,
favourable  to  the  desired  measure,  was  then  taken  up,  and  a  bill
for  its  adoption  subsequently  passed.
On  the  ascension  of  George  I.,  in  1714,  Newton  became  an
object  of  profound  interest  at  court.  His  position  under  govern
ment,  his  surpassing  fame,  his  spotless  character,  and.  above  all,
his  deep  and  consistent  piety,  attracted  the  reverent  regard  of  the
Princess  of  Wales,  afterward  queen -consort  to  George  II.  She
was  a  woman  of  a  highly  cultivated  mind,  and  derived  the  greatest
pleasure  from  conversing  with  Newton  and  corresponding  with
Leibnitz.  One  day,  in  conversation  with  her,  our  author  men
tioned  and  explained  a  new  system  of  chronology,  which  he  had
composed  at  Cambridge,  where  he  had  been  in  the  habit  "  of
refreshing  himself  with  history  and  chronology,  when  he  wac
weary  with  other  studies."  Subsequently,  in  the  year  1718,  she
requested  a  copy  of  this  interesting  and  ingenious  work  Newton,
accordingly,  drew  up  an  abstract  of  the  system  from  the  separate
papers  in  which  it  existed,  and  gave  it  to  her  on  condition  that  it
should  riot  be  communicated  to  any  other  person.  Sometime
afterward  she  requested  that  the  Abbe  Conti  might  be  allowed
to  have  a  copy  of  it  The  author  consented:  and  the  abbe
received  a  copy  of  the  manuscript,  under  the  like  injunction  and
promise  of  secrecy.  This  manuscript  bore  the  title  of  "  A  short
Chronicle,  from  the  First  Memory  of  Tilings  in  Europe,  to  the
Conquest  of  Persia,  by  Alexander  the  Great."
After  Newton  took  up  his  residence  in  London,  he  lived  in  a
style  suited  to  his  elevated  position  and  rank.  He  kept  his  car
riage,  with  an  establishment  of  three  male  and  three  female  serv
ants.  But  to  everything  like  vain  show  and  luxury  he  was  utterly
averse.  His  household  affairs,  for  the  last  twenty  years  of  his
life,  were  under  the  charge  of  his  niece,  Mrs.  Catherine  Barton,
52   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
wife  and  widow  of  Colonel  Barton — a  woman  of  great  beauty  and
accomplishment — and  subsequently  married  to  John  Conduit,  Esq.
At  home  Newton  was  distinguished  by  that  dignified  and  gentle
hospitality  which  springs  alone  from  true  nobleness.  On  all  pro
per  occasions,  he  gave  splendid  entertainments,  though  without
ostentation.  In  society,  whether  of  the  palace  or  the  cottage,
his  manner  was  self-possessed  and  urbane  ;  his  look  benign  and
affable  ;  his  speech  candid  and  modest  ;  his  whole  air  undisturb
edly  serene.  He  had  none  of  what  are  usually  called  the  singu
larities  of  genius  ;  suiting  himself  easily  to  every  company —
except  that  of  the  vicious  and  wicked  ;  and  speaking  of  himself
and  others,  naturally,  so  as  never  even  to  be  suspected  of  vanity.
There  was  in  him,  if  we  may  be  allowed  the  expression,  a  WHOLE
NESS  of  nature,  which  did  not  admit  of  such  imperfections  and
weakness — the  circle  was  too  perfect,  the  law  too  constant,  and
the  disturbing  forces  too  slight  to  suffer  scarcely  any  of  those
eccentricities  which  so  interrupt  and  mar  the  movements  of  many
bright  spirits,  rendering  their  course  through  the  world  more  like
that  of  the  blazing  meteor  than  that  of  the  light  and  life-impart
ing  sun.  In  brief,  the  words  GREATNESS  and  GOODNESS  could
not,  humanly  speaking,  be  more  fitly  employed  than  when  applied
as  the  pre-eminent  characteristics  of  this  pure,  meek  and  vene
rable  sage.
In  the  eightieth  year  of  his  age,  Newton  was  seized  with
symptoms  of  stone  in  the  bladder.  His  disease  was  pronounced
incurable.  He  succeeded,  however,  by  means  of  a  strict  regimen,
and  other  precautions,  in  alleviating  his  complaint,  and  procuring
long  intervals  of  ease.  His  diet,  always  frugai,  was  now  extremely
temperate,  consisting  chiefly  of  broth,  vegetables,  and  fruit,  with,
now  and  then,  a  little  butcher  meat.  He  gave  up  the  use  of  his
carriage,  and  employed,  in  its  stead,  when  he  went  out,  a  chair.
All  invitations  to  dinner  were  declined  ;  and  only  small  parties
were  received,  occasionally,  at  his  own  house.
In  1724  he  wrote  to  the  Lord  Provost  of  Edinburgh,  offering
to  contribute  twenty  pounds  yearly  toward  the  salary  of  Mr.
Maclaurin,  provided  he  accepted  the  assistant  Professorship  of
Mathematics  in  the  University  of  that  place.  Not  only  in  the
LIFE    OP    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   53
cause  of  ingenuity  and  learning,  but  in  that  of  religion —  in  relieving
the  poor  and  .assisting  his  relations,  Newton  annually  expended
large  sums.  He  was  generous  and  charitable  almost  to  a  fault.
Those,  he  would  often  remark,  who  gave  away  nothing  till  they
died,  never  gave  at  all.  His  wealth  had  become  considerable  by
a  prudent  economy  ;  but  he  regarded  money  in  no  other  light
than  as  one  of  the  means  wherewith  he  had  been  intrusted  to  do
good,  and  he  faithfully  employed  it  accordingly.
He  experienced,  in  spite  of  all  his  precautionary  measures,  a
return  of  his  complaint  in  the  month  of  August,  of  the  same  year,
1 724,  when  he  passed  a  stone  the  size  of  pea  ;  it  came  from  him
in  two  pieces,  the  one  at  the  distance  of  two  day.s  from  the  other.
Tolerable  good  health  then  followed  for  some  months.  In  Janu
ary,  1725,  however,  he  was  taken  with  a  violent  cough  and  inflam
mation  of  the  lungs.  In  consequence  of  this  attack,  he  was  pre
vailed  upon  to  remove  to  Kensington,  where  his  health  greatly
improved.  In  February  following,  he  was  attacked  in  both  feet
with  the  gout,  of  the  approach  of  which  he  had  received,  a  few
years  before,  a  slight  warning,  and  the  presence  of  which  now
produced  a  very  beneficial  change  in  his  general  health.  Mr.
Conduit,  his  nephew,  has  recorded  a  curious  conversation  which
took  place,  at  or  near  this  time,  between  himself  and  Sir  Isaac.
"I  was,  on  Sunday  night,  the  7th  March,  1724-5,  at  Kensing
ton,  with  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  his  lodgings,  just  after  he  was  out
of  a  fit  of  the  gout,  which  he  had  had  in  both  of  his  feet,  for  the
first  time,  in  the  eighty-third  year  of  his  age.  He  was  better  after
it,  and  his  head  clearer  and  memory  stronger  than  I  had  known
them  for  some  time.  He  then  repeated  to  me,  by  way  of  dis
course,  very  distinctly,  though  rather  in  answer  to  my  queries,
than  in  one  continued  narration,  what  he  had  often  hinted  to  me
before,  viz. :  that  it  was  his  conjecture  (he  would  affirm  nothing)
that  there  was  a  sort  of  revolution  in  the  heavenly  bodies  ;  that
the  vapours  and  light,  emitted  by  the  sun,  which  had  their  sedi
ment,  as  water  and  other  matter,  had  gathered  themselves,  by
degrees,  into  a  body,  and  attracted  more  matter  from  the  planets,
and  at  last  made  a  secondary  planet  (viz. :  one  of  those  that  go
round  another  planet),  and  then,  by  gathering  to  them,  and
54   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
attracting  more  matter,  became  a  primary  planet ;  and  then,  bf
increasing  still,  became  a  comet,  which,  after  certain  revolutions,
by  coming  nearer  and  nearer  to  the  sun,  had  all  its  volatile  parts
condensed,  and  became  a  matter  tit  to  recruit  and  replenish  the
sun  (which  must  waste  by  the  constant  heat  and  light  it  emitted),
as  a  faggot  would  this  fire  if  put  into  it  (we  were  sitting  by  a
wood  fire),  and  that  that  would  probably  be  the  effect  of  the
comet  of  1680,  sooner  or  later  ;  for,  by  the  observations  made
upon  it,  it  appeared,  before  it  came  near  the  sun,  with  a  tail  only
two  or  three  degrees  long  ;  but,  by  the  heat  it  contracted,  in  going
so  near  the  sun,  it  seemed  to  have  a  tail  of  thirty  or  forty  degrees
when  it  went  frpm  it ;  that  he  could  not  say  when  this  comet
would  drop  into  the  sun  ;  it  might  perhaps  have  five  or  six  revo
lutions  more  first,  but  whenever  it  did  it  would  so  much  increase
the  heat  of  the  sun  that  this  earth  would  be  burned,  and  no  ani
mals  in  it  could  live.  That  he  took  the  three  phenomena,  seen
by  Hipparchus,  Tycho  Brahe,  and  Kepler's  disciples,  to  have  been
of  this  kind,  for  he  could  not  other

wise  account  for  an  extraor
dinary  light,  as  those  were,  appearing,  all  at  once,  among  the
the  fixed  stars  (all  which  he  took  to  be  suns,  enlightening  other
planets,  as  our  sun  does  ours),  as  big  as  Mercury  or  Venus  seems
to  us,  and  gradually  diminishing,  for  sixteen  months,  and  then
sinking  into  nothing.  He  seemed  to  doubt  whether  there  were
not  intelligent  beings,  superior  to  us,  who  superintended  these
revolutions  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  by  the  direction  of  the  Supreme
Being.  He  appeared  also  to  be  very  clearly  of  opinion  that  the
inhabitants  of  this  world  were  of  short  date,  and  alledged,  as  one
reason  for  that  opinion,  that  all  arts,  as  letters,  ships,  printing,
needle,  &c.,  were  discovered  within  the  memory  of  history,  which
could  not  have  happened  if  the  world  had  been  eternal  ;  and  that
there  were  visible  marks  of  ruin  upon  it  which  could  not  be
effected  by  flood  only.  When  I  asked  him  how  this  earth  could
have  been  repeopled  if  ever  it  had  undergone  the  same  fate
it  was  threatened  with  hereafter,  by  the  comet  of  1680,  he
answered,  that  required  the  power  of  a  Creator.  He  said  he
took  all  the  planets  to  be  composed  of  the  same  matter  with  this
earth,  viz. :  earth,  water,  stones,  &c.3  but  variously  concocted.  J
LIFE    OP    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   55
asked  him  why  he  would  not  publish  his  conjectures,  as  conjec
tures,  and  instanced  that  Kepler  had  communicated  his ;  and
though  he  had  not  gone  near  so  far  as  Kepler,  yet  Kepler's
guesses  were  so  just  and  happy  that  they  had  been  proved  and
demonstrated  by  him.  His  answer  was,  "  I  do  not  deal  in  con
jectures."  But,  on  my  talking  to  him  about  the  four  observations
that  had  been  made  of  the  comet  of  1680,  at  574  years'  distance,
and  asking  him  the  particular  times,  he  opened  his  Principia,
which  laid  on  the  table,  and  showed  me  the  particular  periods,
viz.:  1st.  The  Julium  Sidus,  in  the  time  of  Justinian,  in  1106,
in  1680.
"  And  I,  observing  that  he  said  there  of  that  comet,  '  incidet
in  corpus  solis,'  and  in  the  next  paragraph  adds,  '  stellae  fixae
refici  possunt,'  told  him  I  thought  he  owned  there  what  we  had
been  talking  about,  viz. :  that  the  comet  would  drop  into  the  sun,
and  that  fixed  stars  were  recruited  and  replenished  by  comets
when  they  dropped  into  them  ;  and,  consequently,  that  the  sun
would  be  recruited  too ;  and  asked  him  why  he  would  not  own  as
fully  what  he  thought  of  the  sun  as  well  as  what  he  thought  of
the  fixed  stars.  He  said,  'that  concerned  us  more;'  and,  laugh
ing,  added,  that  he  had  said  enough  for  people  to  know  his
meaning."
In  the  summer  of  1725,  a  French  translation  of  the  chronolo
gical  MS.,  of  which  the  Abbe  Conti  had  been  permitted,  some
time  previous,  to  have  a  copy,  was  published  at  Paris,  in  violation
of  all  good  faith.  The  Punic  Abbe  had  continued  true  to  his
promise  of  secrecy  while  he  remained  in  England  ;  but  no  sooner
did  he  reach  Paris  than  he  placed  the  manuscript  into  the  hands
of  M.  Freret,  a  learned  antiquarian,  who  translated  the  work,  and
accompanied  it  with  an  attempted  refutation  of  the  leading  points
of  the  system.  In  November,  of  the  same  year,  Newton  received
a  presentation  copy  of  this  publication,  which  bore  the  title  of

PAR  LUI-MEME,  ET   TRADUIT    SUR    LE    MANUSCRIPT   ANGLAIS.        Soon
afterward  a  paper  entitled,  REMARKS  ON  TFE  OBERVATIONS  MADE

INTO  FRENCH  BY  THE  OBSERVATOR,  ANL  PUBLISHED  AT  PARIS,
56   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,
was  drawn  up  by  our  author,  and  printed  in  the  Philosophical
Transactions  for  1725.  It  contained  a  history  of  the  whole
matter,  and  a  triumphant  reply  to  the  objections  of  M.  Freret.
This  answer  called  into  the  field  a  fresh  antagonist,  Father  Soueiet,
whose  five  dissertations  on  this  subject  were  chiefly  remarkable
for  the  want  of  knowledge  and  want  of  decorum,  which  they
displayed.  In  consequence  of  these  discussions,  Newton  was  in
duced  to  prepare  his  larger  work  for  the  press,  and  had  nearly
completed  it  at  the  time  of  his  death.  It  was  published  in  1728,
under  the  title  of  THE  CHRONOLOGY  OF  THE  ANCIENT  KINGDOMS
AMENDED,  TO  WHICH  is  PREFIXED  A  SHORT  CHRONICLE  FROM  THE
FIRST  MEMORY  OF  THINGS   IN    EUROPE    TO    THE    CONQUEST    OF
PERSIA  BY  ALEXANDER  THE  GREAT.  It  consists  of  six  chap
ters:  1.  On  the  Chronology  of  the  Greeks;  according  to  Whis-
ton,  our  author  wrote  out  eighteen  copies  of  this  chapter  with  his
own  hand,  differing  little  from  one  another.  2.  Of  the  Empire
of  Egypt;  3.  Of  the  Assyrian  Empire;  4.  Of  the  two  contempo
rary  Empires  of  the  Babylonians  and  Medes  ;  5.  A  Description
of  the  Temple  of  Solomon  ;  6.  Of  the  Empire  of  the  Persians  ;
this  chapter  was  not  found  copied  with  the  other  five,  but  as  it
was  discovered  among  his  papers,  arid  appeared  to  be  a  continu
ation  of  the  same  work,  the  Editor  thought  proper  to  add  it
thereto.  Newton's  LETTER  TO  A  PERSON  OF  DISTINCTION  WHO
HAD  DESIRED   HIS  OPINION  OF   THE    LEARNED    BlSHO^    LLOYD'S
HYPOTHESIS  CONCERNING  THE  FORM  OF  THE  MOST  ANCIENT
^EAR,  closes  this  enumeration  of  his  Chronological  Writings.
A  ihird  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  appeared  in  1726,  with  many
changes  and  additions.  About  four  years  were  consumed  in  its
preparation  and  publication,  which  were  under  the  superintend-
ance  of  Dr.  Henry  Pemberton,  an  accomplished  mathematician,
and  the  author  of  "A  VIEW  OF  SIR  ISAAC  NEWTON'S  PHILO
SOPHY."  1728.  This  gentleman  enjoyed  numerous  opportunities
of  conversing  with  the  aged  and  illustrious  author.  "  I  found,"
says  Pemberton,  "  he  had  read  fewer  of  the  modern  mathemati
cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his  own  prodigious
invention  readily  supplied  him  with  what  he  might  have  an  occa
sion  for  in  the  pursuit  of  any  subject  he  undertook.  I  have  often
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   57
heard  him  censure  the  handling  geometrical  subjects  ly  algebraic
calculations  ;  and  his  book  of  Algebra  he  called  by  the  name  of
Universal  Arithmetic,  in  opposition  to  the  injudicious  title  of
Geometry,  which  Descartes  had  given  to  the  treatise,  wherein  he
shows  how  the  geometer  may  assist  his  invention  by  such  kind
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
writer  deserves."
"  Though  his  memory  was  much  decayed,"  continues  Dr.  Pem-
berton,  "he  perfectly  understood  his  own  writings."  And  even
this  failure  of  memory,  we  would  suggest,  might  have  been  more
apparent  than  real,  or,  in  medical  terms,  more  the  result  of  func
tional  weakness  than  organic  decay.  Newton  seems  never  to
have  confided  largely  to  his  memory  :  and  as  this  faculty  mani
fests  the  most  susceptibility  to  cultivation  ;  so,  in  the  neglect  of
due  exercise,  it  more  readily  and  plainly  shows  a  diminution  of
its  powers.
Equanimity  and  temperance  had,  indeed,  preserved  Newton
singularly  free  from  all  mental  and  bodily  ailment.  His  hair  was,
to  the  last,  quite  thick,  though  as  white  as  silver.  He  never
made  use  of  spectacles,  and  lost  but  one  tooth  to  the  day  of  his
death.  He  was  of  middle  stature,  well-knit,  and,  in  the  latter
part  of  his  life,  somewhat  inclined  to  be  corpulent.  Mr.  Conduit
says,  "  he  had  a  very  lively  and  piercing  eye,  a  comely  and  gra
cious  aspect,  with  a  fine  head  of  hair,  white  as  silver,  without  any
baldness,  and  when  his  peruke  was  off  was  a  venerable  sight."
According  to  Bishop  Atterbury,  "in  the  whole  air  of  his  face  and
make  there  was  nothing  of  that  penetrating  sagacity  which
appears  in  his  compositions.  He  had  something  rather  languid
in  his  look  and  manner  which  did  not  raise  any  great  expectation
58   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
in  those  who  did  not  know  him."  Hearne  remarks,  "  Sir  Isaac
was  a  man  of  no  very  promising  aspect.  He  was  a  short,  well-
set  man.  He  was  full  of  thought,  and  spoke  very  little  in  com
pany,  so  that  his  conversation  was  not  agreeable.  When  he  rode
in  his  coach,  one  arm  would  be  out  of  his  coach  on  one  side  and
the  other  on  the  other."  These  different  accounts  we  deem
easily  reconcilable.  In  the  rooms  of  the  Royal  Society,  in  the
street,  or  in  mixed  assemblages,  Newton's  demeanour — always
courteous,  unassuming  and  kindly —  still  had  in  it  the  overawings
of  a  profound  repose  and  reticency,  out  of  which  the  communica
tive  spirit,  and  the  "lively  and  piercing  eye"  would  only  gleam
in  the  quiet  and  unrestrained  freedom  of  his  own  fire-side.
"  But  this  I  immediately  discovered  in  him,"  adds  Pemberton,
still  further,  "which  at  once  both  surprised  and  charmed  me.
Neither  his  extreme  great  age,  nor  his  universal  reputation  had
rendered  him  stiff  in  opinion,  or  in  any  degree  elated.  Of  this  I
had  occasion  to  have  almost  daily  experience.  The  remarks  I
continually  sent  him  by  letters  on  his  Principia,  were  received
with  the  utmost  goodness.  These  were  so  far  from  being  any
ways  displeasing  to  him,  that,  on  the  contrary,  it  occasioned  him
to  speak  many  kind  things  of  me  to  my  friends,  and  to  honour  me
with  a  public  testimony  of  his  good  opinion."  A  modesty,  open
ness,  and  generosity,  peculiar  to  the  noble  and  comprehensive
spirit  of  Newton.  "  Full  of  wisdom  and  perfect  in  beauty,"  yet
not  lifted  up  by  pride  nor  corrupted  by  ambition.  None,  how
ever,  knew  so  well  as  himself  the  stupendousness  of  his  discoveries
in  comparison  with  all  that  had  been  previously  achieved  ;  and
none  realized  so  thoroughly  as  himself  the  littleness  thereof  in
comparison  with  the  vast  region  still  unexplored.  A  short  time
before  his  death  he  uttered  this  memorable  sentiment: —  "  I  do  not
know  what  I  may  appear  to  the  world  ;  but  to  myself  I  seem  to
have  been  only  like  a  boy  playing  on  the  sea-shore,  and  diverting
myself  in  now  and  then  finding  a  smoother  pebble  or  a  prettier
shell  than  ordinary,  while  the  great  ocean  of  truth  lay  all  undis
covered  before  me."  How  few  ever  reach  the  shore  even,  much
less  find  "a  smoother  pebble  or  a  prettier  shell!"
Newton  had  now  resided  about  two  years  at  Kensington  ;  and

the  air  which  he  enjoyed  there,  and  the  state  of  absolute  rest,
proved  of  great  benefit  to  him.  Nevertheless  he  would  occasion
ally  go  to  town.  And  on  Tuesday,  the  28th  of  February,  1727,
he  proceeded  to  London,  for  the  purpose  of  presiding  at  a  meeting
of  the  Royal  Society.  At  this  time  his  health  was  considered,
by  Mr.  Conduit,  better  than  it  had  been  for  many  years.  But
the  unusual  fatigue  he  was  obliged  to  suffer,  in  attending  the
meeting,  and  in  paying  and  receiving  visits,  speedily  produced  a
violent  return  of  the  affection  in  the  bladder.  He  returned  to
Kensington  on  Saturday,  the  4th  of  March.  Dr.  Mead  and  Dr.
Cheselden  attended  him  ;  they  pronounced  his  disease  to  be  the
stone,  and  held  out  no  hopes  of  recovery.  On  Wednesday,  the
15th  of  March,  he  seemed  a  little  better;  and  slight,  though
groundless,  encouragement  was  felt  that  he  might  survive  the
attack.  From  the  very  first  of  it,  his  sufferings  had  been  intense.
Paroxysm  followed  paroxysm,  in  quick  succession  :  large  drops
)f  sweat  rolled  down  his  face  ;  but  not  a  groan,  not  a  complaint,
not  the  least  mark  of  peevishness  or  impatience  escaped  him  :
and  during  the  short  intervals  of  relief,  he  even  smiled  and  con
versed  with  his  usual  composure  and  cheerfulness.  The  flesh
quivered,  but  the  heart  quaked  not  ;  the  impenetrable  gloom  was
settling  down  :  the  Destroyer  near  ;  the  portals  of  the  tomb
opening,  still,  arnid  this  utter  wreck  and  dissolution  of  the  mortal,
the  immortal  remained  serene,  unconquerable  :  the  radiant  light
broke  through  the  gathering  darkness  ;  and  Death  yielded  up  its
sting,  and  the  grave  its  victory.  On  Saturday  morning,  18th,
he  read  the  newspapers,  and  carried  on  a  pretty  long  conversation
with  Dr.  Mead.  His  senses  and  faculties  were  then  strong  and
vigorous  ;  but  at  six  o'clock,  the  same  evening,  he  became  insen
sible  ;  and  in  this  state  he  continued  during  the  whole  of  Sunday,
and  till  Monday,  the  20th,  when  he  expired,  between  one  and
two  o'clock  in  the  morning,  in  the  eighty-fifth  year  of  his  age.
And  these  were  the  last  days  of  Isaac  Newton.  Thus  closed
the  career  of  one  of  earth's  greatest  and  best  men.  His  mission
was  fulfilled.  Unto  the  Giver,  in  many-fold  addition,  the  talents
were  returned.  While  it  was  yet  day  he  had  worked  ;  and  for
the  night  that  quickly  cometh  he  was  not  unprepared.  Full  of

years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled  ;  and,  in
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}'
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity.
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid,
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge.
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose.
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates  :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit  ;  and  the  other,
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit,
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he
had  discharged  during  the  last  two  years  of  Sir  Isaac's  life.
Our  author's  works  are  found  in  the  collection  of  Castilion,
Berlin,  1744,  4to.  8  torn.;  in  Bishop  Horsley's  Edition,  London,
1779,  4to.  5  vol.;  in  the  Biographia  Brittannica,  &c.  Newton
also  published  Bern.  Varcnii  Geographia,  &c.,  1681,  8vo.
There  are,  however,  numerous  manuscripts,  letters,  and  other
papers,  which  have  never  been  given  to  the  world:  these  are
preserved,  in  various  collections,  namely,  in  the  library  of  Trinity
College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  library  of  Corpus  Christi  College,

through  the  Viscountess  Lymington.
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal
Society  of  Edinburgh.
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: —  "  'Tis  built  of  stone,
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-,
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University.
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple-
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the
follow, ng  inscription  : —
"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor

THE    PEINCIPIA.
THE     AUTHOR'S    PREFACE
SINCE  the  ancients  (as  we  are  told  by  Pappus),  made  great  account  oi
the  science  of  mechanics  in  the  investigation  of  natural  things :  and  the
moderns,  laying  aside  substantial  forms  and  occult  qualities,  have  endeav
oured  to  subject  the  phenomena  of  nature  to  the  laws  of  mathematics,  I
have  in  this  treatise  cultivated  mathematics  so  far  as  it  regards  philosophy.
The  ancients  considered  mechanics  in  a  twofold  respect  ;  as  rational,  which
proceeds  accurately  by  demonstration  ;  and  practical.  To  practical  me
chanics  all  the  manual  arts  belong,  from  which  mechanics  took  its  name.
Rut  as  artificers  do  not  work  with  perfect  accuracy,  it  comes  to  pass  that
mechanics  is  so  distinguished  from  geometry,  that  what  is  perfectly  accu
rate  is  called  geometrical  ,  what  is  less  so,  is  called  mechanical.  But  the
errors  are  not  in  the  art,  but  in  the  artificers.  He  that  works  with  less
accuracy  is  an  imperfect  mechanic  ;  and  if  any  could  work  with  perfect
accuracy,  he  would  be  the  most  perfect  mechanic  of  all ;  for  the  description
if  right  lines  and  circles,  upon  which  geometry  is  founded,  belongs  to  me
chanics.  Geometry  does  not  teach  us  to  draw  these  lines,  but  requires
them  to  be  drawn  ;  for  it  requires  that  the  learner  should  f.rst  be  taught
to  describe  these  accurately,  before  he  enters  upon  geometry  ;  then  it  shows
how  by  these  operations  problems  may  be  solved.  To  describe  right  lines
and  circles  are  problems,  but  not  geometrical  problems.  The  solution  of
these  problems  is  required  from  mechanics  ;  and  by  geometry  the  use  of
them,  when  so  solved,  is  shown  ;  and  it  is  the  glory  of  geometry  that  from
those  few  principles,  brought  from  without,  it  is  able  to  produce  so  many
things.  Therefore  geometry  is  founded  in  mechanical  practice,  and  is
nothing  but  that  part  of  universal  mechanics  which  accurately  proposes
and  demonstrates  the  art  of  measuring.  But  since  the  manual  arts  are
chiefly  conversant  in  the  moving  of  bodies,  it  comes  to  pass  that  geometry
is  commonly  referred  to  their  magnitudes,  and  mechanics  to  their  motion.
In  this  sense  rational  mechanics  will  be  the  science  of  motions  resulting
from  any  forces  whatsoever,  and  of  the  forces  required  to  produce  any  mo
tions,  accurately  proposed  and  demonstrated.  This  part  of  mechanics  was
i:;vm   THE  AUTHOR  &  PREFACE.
cultivated  by  the  ancients  in  the  five  powers  which  relate  to  manual  arts,
who  considered  gravity  (it  not  being  a  manual  power),  ho  Otherwise  than
as  it  moved  weights  by  those  powers.  Our  design  not  respecting  arts,  but
philosophy,  and  our  subject  not  manual  but  natural  powers,  we  consider
chiefly  those  things  which  relate  to  gravity,  levity,  elastic  force,  the  resist
ance  of  fluids,  and  the  like  forces,  whether  attractive  or  impulsive ;  and
therefore  we  offer  this  work  as  the  mathematical  principles  :f  philosophy  ;  for
all  the  difficulty  of  philosophy  seems  to  consist  in  this — from  the  phenom
ena  of  motions  to  investigate  the  forces  of  nature,  and  then  from  these
forces  to  demonstrate  the  other  phenomena  ;  and  to  this  end  the  general
propositions  in  the  first  and  second  book  are  directed.  In  the  third  book
we  give  an  example  of  this  in  the  explication  of  the  System  of  the  World  :
for  by  the  propositions  mathematically  demonstrated  in  the  former  books,
we  in  the  third  derive  from  the  celestial  phenomena  the  forces  of  gravity
with  which  bodies  tend  to  the  sun  and  the  several  planets.  Then  from  these
forces,  by  other  propositions  which  are  also  mathematical,  we  deduce  the  mo
tions  of  the  planets,  the  comets,  the  moon,  and  the  sea.  I  wish  we  could  do-
rive  the  rest  of  the  phenomena  of  nature  by  the  same  kind  of  reasoning  from
mechanical  principles;  for  I  am  induced  by  many  reasons  to  suspect  that
they  may  all  depend  upon  certain  forces  by  which  the  particles  of  bodies.
by  some  causes  hitherto  unknown,  are  either  mutually  impelled  towards
each  other,  and  cohere  in  regular  figures,  or  are  repelled  and  recede  from
each  other;  which  forces  being  unknown,  philosophers  have  hitherto  at
tempted  the  search  of  nature  in  vain ;  but  I  hope  the  principles  here  laid
down  will  afford  some  light  either  to  this  or  some  truer  method  of  philosophy.
In  the  publication  of  this  work  the  most  acute  and  universally  learned
Mr.  Edmund  H alley  not  only  assisted  me  with  his  pains  in  correcting  the
press  and  taking  care  of  the  schemes,  but  it  was  to  his  solicitations  that  its
becoming  public  is  owing ;  for  when  he  had  obtained  of  me  my  demonstra
tions  of  the  figure  of  the  celestial  orbits,  he  continually  pressed  me  to  com
municate  the  same  to  the  Royal  Societ //,  who  afterwards,  by  their  kind  en
couragement  and  entreaties,  engaged  me  to  think  of  publishing  them.  But
after  I  had  begun  to  consider  the  inequalities  of  the  lunar  motions,  and
had  entered  upon  some  other  things  relating  to  the  laws  and  measures  oi
gravity,  and  other  forces  :  and  the  figures  that  would  be  described  by  bodies
attracted  according  to  given  laws  ;  and  the  motion  of  several  bodies  moving
among  themselves;  the  motion  of  bodies  in  resisting  mediums;  the  forces,
densities,  and  motions,  of  rn(  Hums  ;  the  orbits  of  the  comets,  and  such  like ;
Ixix
deferred  that  publication  till  I  had  made  a  searcli  into  those  matters,  and
could  put  forth  the  whole  together.  What  relates  to  the  lunar  motions  (be
ing  imperfect),  I  have  put  all  together  in  the  corollaries  of  Prop.  66,  to
avoid  being  obliged  to  propose  and  distinctly  demonstrate  the  several  things
there  contained  in  a  method  more  prolix  than  the  subject  deserved,  and  in
terrupt  the  series  of  the  several  propositions.  Some  things,  found  out  after
the  rest,  I  chose  to  insert  in  places  less  suitable,  rather  than  change  the
number  of  the  propositions  and  the  citations.  I  heartily  beg  that  what  1
have  here  done  may  be  read  with  candour;  and  that  the  defects  in  a
subject  so  difficult  be  not  so  much  reprehended  as  kindly  supplied,  and  in
vestigated  by  new  endeavours  of  mv  readers.  ISAAC  NEWTON.

In  the  second  edition  the  second  section  of  the  first  book  was  enlarged.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids
was  more  accurately  investigated,  and  confirmed  by  new  experiments.  In
the  third  book  the  moon's  theory  and  the  profession  of  the  equinoxes  were
more  fully  deduced  from  their  principles ;  and  the  theory  of  the  comets
was  confirmed  by  more  examples  of  the  calculati  >n  of  their  orbits,  done
also  with  greater  accuracy.
In  this  third  edition  the  resistance  of  mediums  is  somewhat  more  largely
handled  than  before;  and  new  experiments  of  the  resistance  of  heavy
bodies  falling  in  air  are  added.  In  the  third  book,  the  argument  to  prove
that  the  moon  is  retained  in  its  orbit  by  the  force  of  gravity  is  enlarged
on  ;  and  there  are  added  new  observations  of  Mr.  Pound's  of  the  proportion
of  the  diameters  of  Ju.piter  to  each  other  :  there  are,  besides,  added  Mr.
Kirk's  observations  of  the  comet  in  16SO  ;  the  orbit  of  that  comet  com
puted  in  an  ellipsis  by  Dr.  Halley  ;  and  the  ortit  of  the  comet  in
computed  by  Mr.  Bradley,

DEFINITION  I.
77w?  quantity  of  matter  is  the  measure  of  the  same,  arising  from  its
density  and  hulk  conjutictly.
THUS  air  of  a  double  density,  in  a  double  space,  is  quadruple  in  quan-
ti  ty ;  in  a  triple  space,  sextuple  in  quantity.  The  same  thing  is  to  be  un
derstood  of  snow,  and  fine  dust  or  powders,  that  are  condensed  by  compres
sion  or  liquefaction  •  and  of  all  bodies  that  are  by  any  causes  whatever
differently  condensed.  I  have  no  regard  in  this  place  to  a  medium,  if  any
such  there  is,  that  freely  pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi
bodies.  It  is  this  quantity  that  I  mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the
name  of  body  or  mass.  And  the  same  is  known  by  the  weight  of  each
body ;  for  it  is  proportional  to  the  weight,  as  I  have  found  by  experiments
on  pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be  shewn  hereafter.
DEFINITION  II.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
velocity  and  quantity  of  matter  corjunctly.
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is
iouble  ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,
DEFINITION  III.
The  vis  insita,  or  innate  force  of  matter,  is  a  power  of  resisting,  hy
which  every  body,  as  much  as  in  it  lies,  endeavours  to  persevere  in  its
present  stale,  whether  it  be  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward
in  a  right  line.
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving
T4   THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
it.  A  body,  from  the  inactivity  of  matter,  is  not  without  difficulty  put  out
of  its  state  of  rest  or  motion.  Upon  which  account,  this  vis  insita,  may,
by  a  most  significant  name,  be  called  vis  inertia,  or  force  of  inactivity.
Hut  a  body  exerts  this  force  only,  when  another  force,  impressed  upon  it,
endeavours  to  change  its  condition  ;  and  the  exercise  of  this  force  may  bo
considered  both  as  resistance  and  impulse  ;  it  is  resistance,  in  so  far  as  the
body,  for  maintaining  its  present  state,  withstands  the  force  impressed;  it
is  impulse,  in  so  far  as  the  body,  by  not  easily  giving  way  to  the  impressed
force  of  another,  endeavours  to  change  the  state  of  that  other.  Resistance
is  usually  ascribed  to  bodies  at  rest,  and  impulse  to  those  in  motion;
but  motion  and  rest,  as  commonly  conceived,  are  only  relatively  distin
guished  ;  nor  are  those  bodies  always  truly  at  rest,  which  commonly  are
taken  to  be  so.
DKFLMTIOX  IV.
Ait  impressed  force  is  an  action  exerted  upon  a  body,  in  order  to  change
its  state,  either  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward  in  a  right
line.
This  force  consists  in  the  action  only;  and  remains  no  longer  in  the
body,  when  the  action  is  over.  For  a  body  maintains  every  new  state  it
acquires,  by  its  vis  inertice  only.  Impressed  forces  are  of  differe.it  origins  •
as  from  percussion,  from  pressure,  from  centripetal  force.
DEFINITION  V.
A  centripetal  force  is  that  by  which  bodies  are  drawn  or  impelled,  or  any
way  tend,  towards  a  point  as  to  a  centre.
Of  this  sort  is  gravity,  by  which  bodies  tend  to  the  centre  of  the  earth
magnetism,  by  which  iron  tends  to  the  loadstone  ;  and  that  force,  what
ever  it  is,  by  which  the  planets  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from  the  rec
tilinear  motions,  which  otherwise  they  would  pursue,  and  made  to  revolve
in  curvilinear  orbits.  A  stone,  whirled  about  in  a  sling,  endeavours  to  re
cede  from  the  hand  that  turns  it ;  and  by  that  endeavour,  distends  the
sling,  and  that  with  so  much  the  greater  force,  as  it  is  revolved  with  the
greater  velocity,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  is  let  go,  flies  away.  That  force
which  opposes  itself  to  this  endeavour,  and  by  which  the  sling  perpetually
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the  hand,  and  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  because
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits  ;
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
to,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would
tiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it  was  not
for  the  force  of  gravity,  would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth,  tut  would

the  discovery  that  a  projectile  would  move  in  an  elliptical  orbil
when  under  the  influence  of  a  force  varying  inversely  as  the
square  of  the  distance,  was  led  to  discover  "  the  theorem  bj
which  he  afterwards  examined  the  ellipsis ;"  and  to  demonstrate
the  celebrated  proposition  that  a  planet  acted  upon  by  an  attrac
tive  force  varying  inversely  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  will
describe  an  elliptical  orbit,  in  one  of  whose  foci  the  attractive
force  resides.
When  he  was  attending  a  meeting  of  the  Royal  Society,  in
June  1682,  the  conversation  fell  upon  the  subject  of  the  measure
ment  of  a  degree  of  the  meridian,  executed  by  M.  Picard,  a
French  Astronomer,  in  1679.  Newton  took  a  memorandum  oi
the  result  ;  and  afterward,  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  computed
from  it  the  diameter  of  the  earth  :  furnished  with  these  new  data,
he  resumed  his  calculation  of  1666.  As  he  proceeded  therein,
he  saw  that  his  early  expectations  were  now  likely  to  be  realized  ;
the  thick  rushing,  stupendous  results  overpowered  him  ;  he  be
came  unable  to  carry  on  the  process  of  calculation,  and  intrusted
its  completion  to  one  of  his  friends.  The  discoverer  had,  indeed,
grasped  the  master-fact.  The  law  of  falling  bodies  at  the  earth's
surface  was  at  length  identified  with  that  which  guided  the  moon
in  her  orbit.  And  so  his  GREAT  THOUGHT,  that  had  for  sixteen
years  loomed  up  in  dim,  gigantic  outline,  amid  the  first  dawn  of  a
plausible  hypothesis,  now  stood  forth,  radiant  and  not  less  grand,
in  the  mid-day  light  of  demonstrated  truth.
It  were  difficult,  nay  impossible  to  imagine,  even,  the  influence
of  a  result  like  this  upon  a  mind  like  Newton's.  It  was  as  if  the
keystone  had  been  fitted  to  the  glorious  arch  by  which  his  spirit
should  ascend  to  the  outskirts  of  infinite  space — spanning  the  immea
surable — weighing  the  imponderable — computing  the  incalculable
—mapping  out  the  marchings  of  the  planets,  and  the  far-wander
ings  of  the  comefs,  and  catching,  bring  back  to  earth  some  clearer
notes  of  that  higher  melody  which,  as  a  sounding  voice,  bears
perpetual  witness  to  the  design  and  omnipotence  of  a  creating
Deity.
Newton,  extending  the  law  thus  obtained,  composed  a  series
of  about  twelve  propositions  on  the  motion  of  the  primary  planets

about  the  sun.  These  were  sent  to  London,  and  communicated
to  the  Royal  Society  about  the  end  of  1683.  At  or  near  this  pe
riod,  other  philosophers,  as  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  Dr.  Halley,
and  Dr.  Hooke,  were  engaged  in  investigating  the  same  subject ;
but  with  no  definite  or  satisfactory  results.  Dr.  Halley,  having
seen,  it  is  presumed,  our  author's  propositions,  went  in  August,
1684,  to  Cambridge  to  consult  with  him  upon  the  subject.
Newton  assured  him  that  he  had  brought  the  demonstration  to
perfection.  In  November,  Dr.  Halley  received  a  copy  of  the
work  ;  and,  in  the  following  month^  announced  .  it  to  the  Royal
Society,  with  the  author's  promise  to  have  it  entered  upon  their
Register.  Newton,  subsequently  reminded  by  the  Society  of  his
promise,  proceeded  in  the  diligent  preparation  of  the  work,  and.
though  suffering  an  interruption  of  six  weeks,  transmitted  the
manuscript  of  the  first  book  to  London  before  the  end  of  April.
The  work  was  entitled  PHILOSOPHI/E  NATURALIS  PRINCIPIA
MATHEMATICA,  dedicated  to  the  Royal  Society,  and  presented
thereto  on  the  28th  of  April,  1685-6.  The  highest  encomiums
were  passed  upon  it ;  and  the  council  resolved,  on  the  19th  of
May,  to  print  it  at  the  expense  of  the  Society,  and  under  the  di
rection  of  Dr.  Halley.  The  latter,  a  few  days  afterward,  com
municated  these  steps  to  Newton,  who,  in  a  reply,  dated  the  20th
of  June,  holds  the  following  language  : —  "  The  proof  you  sent  me
I  like  very  well.  I  designed  the  whole  to  consist  of  three  books  ;
the  second  was  finished  last  summer,  being  short,  and  only  wants
transcribing,  and  drawing  the  cuts  fairly.  Some  new  propositions
I  have  since  thought  on,  which  I  can  as  well  let  alone.  The
third  wants  the  theory  of  comets.  In  autumn  last,  I  spent  two
months  in  calculation  to  no  purpose  for  want  of  a  good  method,
which  made  me  afterward  return  to  the  first  book,  and  enlarge  it
with  diverse  propositions,  some*  relating  to  comets,  others  to  other
things  found  ouf  last  winter.  The  third  I  now  design  to  sup
press.  Philosophy  is  such  an  impertinently  litigious  lady,  that  a
man  had  as  good  be  engaged  in  l«iw-suits  as  have  to  do  with  her.
I  found  it  so  formerly,  and  now  I  can  no  sooner  come  near  her
again,  but  she  gives  me  warning.  The  first  two  books  without
the  third  will  not  so  well  bear  the  title  of  P/iilosophicc  Naturalis

Principia  Mathematicia  ;  and  thereupon  I  had  altered  it  to  this,
De  Motu  Corporum  Libri  duo.  But  after  second  thought  I  re
tain  the  former  title.  It  will  help  the  sale  of  the  book,  which  I
ought  not  to  diminish  now  'tis  yours."
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr.
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of
Kepler.
The  suppression  of  the  third  book  Dr.  Halley  could  not  endure
to  see.  "  I  must  again  beg  you"  says  he,  "  not  to  let  your  re
sentments  run  so  high  as  to  deprive  us  of  your  third  book,  where
in  your  applications  of  your  mathematical  doctrine  to  the  theory
of  comets,  and  several  curious  experiments,  which,  as  I  guess  by
what  you  write  ought  to  compose  it,  will  undoubtedly  render  it
acceptable  to  those  who  will  call  themselves  philosophers  without
mathematics,  which  are  much  the  greater  number."  To  these
solicitations  Newton  yielded.  There  were  no  "resentments,"  how
ever,  as  we  conceive,  in  his  "  design  to  suppress."  He  sought
peace  ;  for  he  loved  and  valued  it  above  all  applause.  But,  in
spite  of  his  efforts  for  tranquillity's  sake,  his  course  of  discovery
was  all  along  molested  by  ignorance  or  presumptuous  rivalry.
The  publication  of  the  great  work  now  went  rapidly  forwards,
The  second  book  was  sent  to  the  Society,  and  presented  on  the
2d  March  ;  the  third,  on  the  6th  April ;  and  the  whole  was  com
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world  ;  but
its  algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till  published  in  the
second  volume  nf  Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in  1693.
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work
to  which  pre-eminence  above  all  the  productions  of  the  human
intellect  has  been  awarded — a  work  that  must  be  esteemed  of
priceless  worth  so  long  as  Science  has  a  votary,  or  a  single  wor
shipper  be  left  to  kneel  at  the  altar  of  Truth.
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   33
The  entire  work  bears  the  general  title  of  THE  MATHEMATICAL
PRINCIPLES  OF  NATURAL  PHILOSOPHY.  It  consists  of  three  books:
the  first  two,  entitled,  OF  THE  MOTION  OF  BODIES,  are  occupied
with  the  laws  and  conditions  of  motions  and  forces,  and  are  illus
trated  with  many  scholia  treating  of  some  of  the  most  general
and  best  established  points  in  philosophy,  such  as  the  density  and
resistance  of  bodies,  spaces  void  of  matter,  and  the  motion  of
sound  and  light.  From  these  principles,  there  is  deduced,  in  the
third  book,  drawn  up  in  as  popular  a  style  as  possible  and  entitled,
OF  THE  SYSTEM  OF  THE  WORLD,  the  constitution  of  the  system  of
i he  world.  In  regard  to  this  book,  the  author  say^  — "  I  had,  indeed,
composed  the  third  Book  in  a  popular  method,  that  it  might  be  read
by  many  ;  but  afterwards,  considering  that  such  as  had  not  suf-
ficently  entered  into  the  principles  could  not  easily  discover  the
strength  of  the  consequences,  nor  lay  aside  the  prejudices  to  which
they  had  been  many  years  accustomed,  therefore,  to  prevent  dis
putes  which  might  be  raised  upon  such  accounts,  I  chose  to  reduce
the  substance  of  this  Book  into  the  form  of  Propositions  (in  the
mathematical  way),  which  should  be  read  by  those  only  who  had
first  made  themselves  masters  of  the  principles  established  in  the
preceding  Books  :  not  that  I  would  advise  any  one  to  the  previous
study  of  every  Proposition  of  those  Books." —  "It  is  enough  it
one  carefully  reads  the  Definitions,  the  Laws  of  Motion,  and  the
three  first  Sections  of  the  first  Book.  He  may  then  pass  on  to
this  Book,  and  consult  such  of  the  remaining  Propositions  of  the
first  two  Books,  as  the  references  in  this,  and  his  occasions  shall  re
quire."  So  that  "  The  System  of  the  World"  is  composed  both
"  in  a  popular  method,"  and  in  the  form  of  mathematical  Propo
sitions.
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always
directed  to  the  sun  ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic
section  ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle  ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres  ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*'
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System —  all  the  move
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica
ble  phenomena.
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  to  each,  each  to  all,
and  all  to  each — in  the  mysterious  bonds  of  a  ceaseless,  recipro
cal  influence.  An  influence  whose  workings  are  shown  to  be
alike  present  in  the  globular  dew-drop,  or  oblate-spheroidal  earth  ;
in  the  falling  shower,  or  vast  heaving  ocean  tides ;  in  the  flying
thistle-down,  or  fixed,  ponderous  rock  ;  in  the  swinging  pendulum,
or  time-measuring  sun  ;  in  the  varying  and  unequal  moon,  or
earth's  slowly  retrograding  poles  ;  in  the  uncertain  meteor,  or
oiazing  comet  wheeling  swiftly  away  on  its  remote,  yet  determined
round.  An  influence,  in  fine,  that  may  link  system  to  system

merit  ;  aye,  firmament  to  firmament,  again  and  again,  till,  con
verging  home,  it  may  be,  to  some  ineffable  centre,  where  more
presently  dwells  He  who  inhabiteth  immensity,  and  where  infini
tudes  meet  and  eternities  have  their  condux,  and  where  around
move,  in  softest,  swiftest  measure,  all  the  countless  hosts  that
crowd  heaven's  fathomless  deeps.
And  yet  Newton,  amid  the  loveliness  and  magnitude  of  Om
nipotence,  lost  not  sight  of  the  Almighty  One.  A  secondary,
however  universal,  was  not  taken  for  the  First  Cause.  An  im
pressed  force,  however  diffused  and  powerful,  assumed  not  the
functions  of  the  creating,  giving  Energy.  Material  beauties,
splendours,  and  sublimities,  however  rich  in  glory,  and  endless  in
extent,  concealed  not  the  attributes  of  an  intelligent  Supreme.
From  the  depths  of  his  own  soul,  through  reason  and  the  WORD,
he  had  risen,  a  priori,  to  God  :  from  the  heights  of  Omnipotence,
through  the  design  and  law  of  the  builded  universe,  he  proved  </
posteriori,  a  Deity.  "  I  had,"  says  he,  "  an  eye  upon  such  prin
ciples  as  might  work,  with  considering  men,  for  the  belief  of  a
Deity,"  in  writing  the  PRINCIPIA  ;  at  the  conclusion  whereof,  he
teaches  that —  "  this  most  beautiful  system  of  the  sun,  planets  and
comets,  could  only  proceed  from  the  counsel  and  dominion  of  an
intelligent  and  powerful  Being.  And  if  the  fixed  stars  are  the
centres  of  other  like  systems,  these,  being  forme  1  by  the  like
wise  counsels,  must  be  all  subject  to  the  dominion  of  One ;  especially
since  the  light  of  the  fixed  stars  is  of  the  same  nature  with  the
light  of  the  sun,  and  from  every  system  light  passes  into  all  other
systems  :  and  lest  the  systems  of  the  fixed  stars  should,  by  their
gravity,  fall  on  each  other  mutually,  he  hath  placed  those  systems
at  immense  distances  one  from  another.
"  This  Being  governs  all  things,  not  as  the  soul  of  the  world,
but  as  Lord  over  all ;  and  on  account  of  his  dominion  he  is  wont,
to  be  called  Lord  God  Travrowparwp  or  Universal  Ruler  ;  for  God
is  a  relative  word,  and  has  a  respect  to  servants  ;  and  Deity  is
the  dominion  of  God,  not  over  his  own  body,  as  those  imagine
who  fancy  God  to  be  the  soul  of  the  world,  but  over  servants.
The  Supreme  God  is  a  Being  eternal,  infinite,  absolutely  perfect ;
but  a  being,  however  perfect,  without  dominion,  cannot  be  said  to
36   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
be  Lord  God  ;  for  we  say,  my  God,  your  God,  the  God  of  Israel
the  God  of  Gods,  and  Lord  of  Lords  ;  but  we  do  not  say,  my
Eternal,  your  Eternal,  the  Eternal  of  Israel,  the  Eternal  of  Gods  :
we  do  not  say  my  Infinite,  or  my  Perfect  :  these  are  titles  which
have  no  respect  to  servants.  The  word  God  usually  signifies
Lord  ;  but  every  Lord  is  not  God.  It  is  the  dominion  of  a  spir
itual  Being  which  constitutes  a  God  ;  a  true,  supreme,  or  imagi
nary  dominion  makes  a  true,  supreme,  or  imaginary  God.  And
from  his  true  dominion  it  follows  that  the  true  God  is  a  living,
intelligent  and  powerful  Being ;  and  from  his  other  perfections,
that  he  is  supreme  or  most  perfect.  He  is  eternal  and  in
finite,  omnipotent  and  omniscient  ;  that  is,  his  duration  reaches
from  eternity  to  eternity  ;  his  presence  from  infinity  to  infinity ;
he  governs  all  things  and  knows  all  things,  that  are  or  can  be
done.  He  is  not  eternity  or  infinity,  but  eternal  and  infinite  ;
he  is  not  duration  and  space,  but  he  endures  and  is  present.
He  endures  forever  and  is  everywhere  present  ;  and  by  existing
always  and  everywhere,  he  constitutes  duration  and  space.  Since
every  particle  of  space  is  always,  and  every  indivisible  moment
of  duration  is  everywhere,  certainly  the  Maker  and  Lord  of  things
cannot  be  never  and  nowhere.  Every  soul  that  has  perception
is,  though  in  different  times  and  different  organs  of  sense  and  mo
tion,  still  the  same  indivisible  person.  There  are  given  succes
sive  parts  in  duration,  co-existent  parts  in  space,  but  neither  the
one  nor  the  other  in  the  person  of  a  man,  or  his  thinking
principle  ;  and  much  less  can  they  be  found  in  the  thinking  sub
stance  of  God.  Every  man.  so  far  as  he  is  a  thing  that  has  j:er-
ceptiori,  is  one  and  the  same  man  during  his  whole  life,  in  all  and
each  of  his  organs  of  sense.  God  is  one  and  the  same  God,  al
ways  and  everywhere.  He  is  omnipresent,  not  virtually  only,
but  also  substantially  ;  for  virtue  cannot  subsist  without  sub
stance.  In  him  are  all  things  contained  and  moved  ;  yet  neither
affects  the  other  ;  God  suffers  nothing  from  the  motion  of  bodies  ;
bodies  find  no  resistance  from  the  omnipresence  of  God.  It  is
allowed  by  all  that  the  Supreme  God  exists  necessarily  ;  and  by
the  same  necessity  he  exists  always  and  everywhere.  Whence
also  he  is  all  similar,  all  eye,  all  ear,  all  brain,  all  arm,  all  powei

to  perceive,  to  understand,  and  to  act  ;  but  in  a  manner  not  at  all
human,  in  a  manner  not  at  all  corporeal,  in  a  manner  utterly  un
known  to  us.  As  a  blind  man  has  no  idea  of  colours,  so  have  we
no  idea  of  the  manner  by  which  the  all-wise  God  perceives  and
understands  all  things.  He  is  utterly  void  of  all  body,  and  bodily
figure,  and  can  therefore  neither  be  seen,  nor  heard,  nor  touched  ;
nor  ought  he  to  be  worshipped  under  the  representation  of  any
corporeal  thing.  We  have  ideas  of  his  attributes,  but  what  the
real  substance  of  anything  is  we  know  not.  In  bodies  we  see
only  their  figures  and  colours,  we  hear  only  the  sounds,  we  touch
only  their  outward  surfaces,  we  smell  only  the  smells,  and  taste
only  the  savours  ;  but  their  inward  substances  are  not  to  be  known,
either  by  our  senses,  or  by  any  reflex  act  of  our  minds  :  much
less,  then,  have  we  any  idea  of  the  substance  of  God.  We  know
him  only  by  his  most  wise  and  excellent  contrivances  of  things,
and  final  causes  ;  we  admire  him  for  his  perfections  ;  but  we  rev
erence  and  adore  him  on  account  of  his  dominion  ;  for  we  adore
him  as  his  servants  ;  and  a  god  without  dominion,  providence,  and
final  causes,  is  nothing  else  but  Fate  and  Nature.  Blind  meta
physical  necessity,  which  is  certainly  the  same  always  and  every
where,  could  produce  no  variety  of  things.  All  that  diversity  of
natural  things  which  we  find  suited  to  different  times  and  places
could  arise  from  nothing  but  the  ideas  and  will  of  a  Being  neces
sarily  existing."
Thus,  the  diligent  student  of  science,  the  earnest  seeker  of
truth,  led,  as  through  the  courts  of  a  sacred  Temple,  wherein,  at
each  step,  new  wonders  meet  the  eye,  till,  as  a  crowning  grace,
they  stand  before  a  Holy  of  Holies,  and  learn  that  all  science  and
all  truth  are  one  which  hath  its  beginning  and  its  end  in  the
knowledge  of  Him  whose  glory  the  heavens  declare,  and  whose
handiwork  the  firmament  showeth  forth.
The  introduction  of  the  pure  and  lofty  doctrines  of  the  PRIN-
CIPIA  was  perseveringly  resisted.  Descartes, with  his  system  of
vortices,  had  sown  plausibly  to  the  imagination,  and  error  had
struck  down  deeply,  and  shot  up  luxuriantly,  not  only  in  the
popular,  but  in  the  scientific  mind.  Besides  the  idea —  in  itself  so
simple  and  so  grand — that  the  great  masses  of  the  planets  were
38   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
suspended  in  empty  space,  and  retained  in  their  orbits  by  an  in
visible  influence  residing  in  the  sun — was  to  the  ignorant  a  thing
inconceivable,  and  to  the  learned  a  revival  of  the  occult  qualities
of  the  ancient  physics.  This  remark  applies  particularly  to  the
continent.  Leibnitz  misapprehended  ;  Huygens  in  part  rejected  ;
John  Bernouilli  opposed  ;  and  Fontenelle  never  received  the  doc
trines  of  the  PRINCIPIA.  So  that,  the  saying  of  Voltaire  is  prob
ably  true,  that  though  Newton  survived  the  publication  of  his
great  work  more  than  forty  years,  yet,  at  the  time  of  his  death,
lie  had  not  above  twenty  followers  out  of  England.
But  in  England,  the  reception  of  our  author's  philosophy  was
rapid  and  triumphant.  His  own  labours,  while  Lucasian  Pro
fessor  ;  those  of  his  successors  in  that  Chair — Whiston  and
Saunderson  ;  those  of  Dr.  Samuel  Clarke,  Dr.  Laughton,  Roger
Cotes,  and  Dr.  Bentley  ;  the  experimental  lectures  of  Dr.  Keill
and  Desaguliers  ;  the  early  and  powerful  exertions  of  David
Gregory  at  Edinburgh,  and  of  his  brother  James  Gregory  at  St.
Andrew's,  tended  to  diffuse  widely  in  England  and  Scotland  a
knowledge  of,  and  taste  for  the  truths  of  the  PRINCIPIA.  Indeed,
its  mathematical  doctrines  constituted,  from  the  first,  a  regular
part  of  academical  instruction  ;  while  its  physical  truths,  given  to
the  public  in  popular  lectures,  illustrated  by  experiments,  had,
before  the  lapse  of  twenty  )  (  ar.s,  become  familiar  to,  and  adopted
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of
the  PRINCIPIA.
About  the  time  of  the  publication  of  the  Principia,  James  II.,
bent  on  re-establishing  the  Romish  Faith,  had,  among  other  ille
gal  acts,  ordered  by  mandamus,  the  University  of  Cambridge  to
confer  the  degree  of  Master  of  Arts  upon  an  ignorant  monk.
Obedience  to  this  mandate  was  resolutely  refused.  Newton  was
one  of  the  nine  delegates  chosen  to  defend  the  independence  of
the  University.  They  appeared  before  the  High  Court  ; — and

successfully  :  the  king  abandoned  his  design.  The  prominent
part  which  our  author  took  in  these  proceedings,  and  his  eminence
in  the  scientific  world,  induced  his  proposal  as  one  of  the  parlia
mentary  representatives  of  the  University.  He  was  elected,  in
1688,  and  sat  in  the  Convention  Parliament  till  its  dissolution.
After  the  first  year,  however,  he  seems  to  have  given  little  or  no
attention  to  his  parliamentary  duties,  being  seldom  absent  from
the  University  till  his  appointment  in  the  Mint,  in  1695.
Newton  began  his  theological  researches  sometime  previous  to
1691  ;  in  the  prime  of  his  years,  and  in  the  matured  vigour  of
his  intellectual  powers.  From  his  youth,  as  we  have  seen,  he
had  devoted  himself  with  an  activity  the  most  unceasing,  and  an
energy  almost  superhuman  to  the  discovery  of  physical  truth  ; —
giving  to  Philosophy  a  new  foundation,  and  to  Science  a  new
temple.  To  pass  on,  then,  from  the  consideration  of  the  material,
more  directly  to  that  of  the  spiritual,  was  a  natural,  nay,  with  so
large  and  devout  a  soul,  a  necessary  advance.  The  Bible  was  to
him  of  inestimable  worth.  In  the  elastic  freedom,  which  a  pure
and  unswerving  faith  in  Him  of  Nazareth  gives,  his  mighty  facul
ties  enjoyed  the  only  completest  scope  for  development.  His
original  endowment,  however  great,  combined  with  a  studious
application,  however  profound,  would  never,  without  this  libera
tion  from  the  dominion  of  passion  and  sense,  have  enabled  him  to
attain  to  that  wondrous  concentration  and  grasp  of  intellect,  for
which  Fame  has  as  yet  assigned  him  no  equal.  Gratefully  he
owned,  therefore,  the'same  Author  in  the  Book  of  Nature  and  the
Book  of  Revelation.  These  were  to  him  as  drops  of  the  same
unfathomable  ocean  ; — as  outrayings  of  the  same  inner  splendour  ;
— as  tones  of  the  same  ineffable  voice  ; — as  segments  of  the  same
infinite  curve.  "With  great  joy  he  had  found  himself  enabled  to
proclaim,  as  an  interpreter,  from  the  hieroglyphs  of  Creation,  the
existence  of  a  God  :  and  now,  with  greater  joy,  and  in  the  fulness
of  his  knowledge,  and  in  the  fulness  of  his  strength,  he  laboured
to  make  clear,  from  the  utterances  of  the  inspired  Word,  the  far
mightier  confirmations  of  a  Supreme  Good,  in  all  its  glorious
amplitude  of  Being  and  of  Attribute  ;  and  to  bring  the  infallible
workings  thereof  plainly  home  to  the  understandings  and  the

own  testimony  in  favour  of  that  Religion,  whose  truth  is  now.  in
deed,  "  girded  with  the  iron  and  the  rock  of  a  ponderous  and  co
lossal  demonstration."
His  work,  entitled,  OBSERVATIONS  UPON  THE  PROPHECIES  OF
HOLY  WRIT,  PARTICULARLY  THE  PROPHECIES  OF  DANIEL  AND  THE
APOCALYPSE  OF  ST.  JOHN,  first  published  in  London,  in  1733  4to.
consists  of  two  parts  :  the  one  devoted  to  the  Prophecies  oi
Daniel,  and  the  other  to  the  Apocalypse  of  St.  John.  In  the  first
part,  he  treats  concerning  the  compilers  of  the  books  of  the  Old
Testament  ; — of  the  prophetic  language  ; — of  the  vision  of  the
four  beasts  ; — of  the  kingdoms  represented  by  the  feet  of  the
image  composed  of  iron  and  clay  ; — of  the  ten  kingdoms  repre
sented  by  the  ten  horns  of  the  beast  ; — of  the  eleventh  horn  of
Daniel's  fourth  beast  ;  of  the  power  which  should  change  times
and  laws  ;— of  the  kingdoms  represented  in  Daniel  by  the  ram
and  he-goat  ; — of  the  prophecy  of  the  seventy  weeks  ; — of  the
times  of  the  birth  and  passion  of  Christ  ; —  of  the  prophecy  of  the
Scripture  of  Truth  ; —  of  the  king  who  doeth  according  to  his  will,
and  magnified  himself  above  every  god,  and  honoured  Mahuzzims,
and  regarded  not  the  desire  of  women  ; — of  the  Mahuzzim,  hon
oured  by  the  king  who  doeth  according  to  his  will.  In  the  sec
ond  part,  he  treats  of  the  time  when  the  Apocalypse  was  written  ,
of  the  scene  of  the  vision,  and  the  relation  which  the  Apocalypse
has  to  the  book  of  the  law  of  Moses,  and  to  the  worship  of  God
in  the  temple  ; — of  the  relation  which  the  Apocalypse  has  to  the
prophecies  of  Daniel,  and  of  the  subject  of  the  prophecy  itself
Newton  regards  the  prophecies  as  given,  not  for  the  gratification
of  man's  curiosity,  by  enabling  him  to  foreknow  ;  but  for  his  con
viction  that  the  world  is  governed  by  Providence,  by  witnessing
their  fulfilment.  Enough  of  prophecy,  he  thinks,  has  already
been  fulfilled  to  afford  the  diligent  seeker  abundant  evidence  of
God's  providence.  The  whole  work  is  marked  by  profound
erudition,  sagacity  and  argument.
And  not  less  learning,  penetration  and  masterly  reasoning  are
conspicuous  in  his  HISTORICAL  ACCOUNT  OF  Two  NOTABLE
CORRUPTIONS  OF  SCRIPTURES  IN  A  LETTER  TO  A  FRIEND.  This
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   41
Treatise,  first  accurately  published  in  Dr.  Horsley's  edition  of  his
works,  relates  to  two  texts  :  the  one,  1  Epistle  of  St.  John  v.  7 ;
the  other,  1  Epistle  of  St.  Paul  to  Timothy  iii.  16.  As  this
work  had  the  effect  to  deprive  the  advocates  of  the  doctrine  of
the  Trinity  of  two  leading  texts,  Newton  has  been  looked  upon
as  an  Arian  ;  but  there  is  absolutely  nothing  in  his  writings  to
warrant  such  a  conclusion.
His  regaining  theological  works  consist  of  the  LEXICON  PRO-
PHETICUM,  which  was  left  incomplete  ;  a  Latin  Dissertation  on
the  sacred  cubit  of  the  Jews,  which  was  translated  into  English,
and  published,  in  1737.  among  the  Miscellaneous  Works  of  John
Greaves  ;  and  FOUR  LETTERS  addressed  to  Dr.  Bentlty,  contain
ing  some  arguments  in  proof  of  a  Deity.  These  Letters  were
dated  respectively  :  10th  December,  1692  ;  17th  January,  1693  ;
25th  February,  1693;  and  llth  February,  1693— the  fourth
bearing  an  earlier  date  than  the  third.  The  best  faculties  and
the  profoundest  acquirements  of  our  author  are  convincingly
manifest  in  these  lucid  and  powerful  compositions.  They  were
published  in  1756,  and  reviewed  by  Dr.  Samuel  Johnson.
Newton's  religious  writings  are  distinguished  by  their  absolute
freedom  from  prejudice.  Everywhere,  throughout  them,  there
glows  the  genuine  nobleness  of  soul.  To  his  whole  life,  indeed,
we  may  here  fitly  extend  the  same  observation.  He  was  most
richly  imbued  with  the  very  spirit  of  the  Scriptures  which  he  so
delighted  to  study  and  to  meditate  upon.  His  was  a  piety,  so
fervent,  so  sincere  and  practical,  that  it  rose  up  like  a  holy  incense
from  every  thought  and  act.  His  a  benevolence  that  not  only
willed,  but  endeavoured  the  best  for  all.  His  a  philanthropy
that  held  in  the  embracings  of  its  love  every  brother-man.
His  a  toleration  of  the  largest  and  the  truest  ;  condemning  per
secution  in  every,  even  its  mildest  form  ;  and  kindly  encouraging
each  striving  after  excellence  : —  .1  toleration  that  came  not  of
indifference — for  the  immoral  and  the  impious  met  with  their
quick  rebuke — but  a  toleration  that  came  of  the  wise  humbleness
and  the  Christian  charity,  which  see,  in  the  nothingness  of  self
and  the  almightiness  of  TRUTH,  no  praise  for  the  ablest,  and  no
blame  for  th^  feeblest  in  their  strugglings  upward  to  light  and  life.

  an  invention  the  most  exuberant.  But  in  him  there
was  a  conjunction  of  influences  as  extraordinary  as  fortunate.
Study,  unbroken,  persevering  and  profound  carried  on  its  inform
ing  and  disciplining  work  upon  a  genius,  natively  the  greatest,
and  rendered  freest  in  its  movements,  and  clearest  in  its  vision,
through  the  untrammelling  and  enlig}  tenirig  power  of  religion.
And,  in  this  happy  concurrence,  are  to  be  sought  the  elements  of
those  amazing  abilities,  which,  grasping,  with  equal  facility,  the
18   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
minute  and  the  stupendous,  brought  these  successively  to  light,
and  caused  science  to  make  them  her  own.
In  1667,  Newton  was  made  a  Junior  Fellow  ;  and,  in  the  year
following,  he  took  his  degree  of  Master  of  Arts,  and  was  appoint
ed  to  a  Senior  Fellowship.
On  his  return  to  Cambridge,  in  1668,  he  resumed  his  optical
labours.  Having  thought  of  a  delicate  method  of  polishing  metal,
he  proceeded  to  the  construction  of  his  newly  projected  reflect
ing  telescope  ;  a  small  specimen  of  which  he  actually  made  with
his  own  hands,  It  was  six  inches  long  ;  and  magnified  about
forty  times  ; — a  power  greater  than  a  refracting  instrument  of  six
feet  tube  could  exert  with  distinctness.  Jupiter,  with  his  four
satellites,  and  the  horns,  or  moon-like  phases  of  Venus  were
plainly  visible  through  it.  THIS  WAS  THE  FIRST  REFLECTING
TELESCOPE     EVER     EXECUTED     AND     DIRECTED     TO     THE     HEAVENS.
He  gave  an  account  of  it,  in  a  letter  to  a  friend,  dated  February  23d,
1668-9 — a  letter  which  is  also  remarkable  for  containing  the  firs'
allusion  to  his  discoveries  "  concerning  the  nature  of  light."  En
couraged  by  the  success  of  his  first  experiment,  he  again  executed
with  his  own  hands,  not  long  afterward,  a  second  and  superior
instrument  of  the  same  kind.  The  existence  of  this  having  come
to  the  knowledge  of  the  Royal  Society  of  London,  in  1671,  they
requested  it  of  Newton  for  examination.  He  accordingly  sent  it
to  them,  It  excited  great  admiration;  it  was  shown  to  the  king*
a  drawing  and  description  of  it  was  sent  to  Paris  ;  and  the  tele-
scope  itself  was  carefully  preserved  in  the  Library  of  the  Society.
Newton  lived  to  see  his  invention  in  public  use,  and  of  eminent
service  in  the  cause  of  science.
In  the  spring  of  1669,  he  wrote  to  his  friend  Francis  Aston,
Esq.,  then  about  setting  out  on  his  travels,  a  letter  of  advice  and
directions,  it  was  dated  May  18th,  and  is  interesting  as  exhibit
ing  some  of  the  prominent  features  in  Newton's  character.
Thus  : —
"  Since  in  your  letter  you  give  me  so  much  liberty  of  spending
my  judgment  about  what  may  be  to  your  advantage  in  travelling,
1  shall  do  it  more  freely  than  perhaps  otherwise  would  have  been
decent,  Fir,ct,  then,  I  will  lay  down  some  general  rules,  most  of
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   19
which,  I  bolieA  e,  you  have  considered  already  ;  but  if  any  of
them  be  new  to  you,  they  may  excuse  the  rest  ;  if  none  at  all,
yet  is  my  punishment  more  in  writing  than  yours  in  reading.
"When  you  come  into  any  fresh  company.  1.  Observe  their
humours.  2.  Suit  your  own  carriage  thereto,  by  which  insinua
tion  you  will  make  their  converse  more  free  and  open.  3.  Let
your  discourse  be  more  in  queries  and  doubtings  than  peremptory
assertions  or  disputings,  it  being  the  design  of  travellers  to  learn,
not  to  teach.  Besides,  it  will  persuade  your  acquaintance  that
you  have  the  greater  esteem  of  them,  and  so  make  them  more
ready  to  communicate  what  they  know  to  you  ;  whereas  nothing
sooner  occasions  disrespect  and  quarrels  than  peremptoriness.
You  will  find  little  or  no  advantage  in  seeming  wiser  or  much
more  ignorant  than  your  company.  4.  Seldom  discommend  any
thing  though  never  so  bad,  or  do  it  but  moderately,  lest  you  be
unexpectedly  forced  to  an  unhandsome  retraction.  It  is  safer  to
commend  any  thing  more  than  it  deserves,  than  to  discommend
a  thing  so  much  as  it  deserves;  for  commendations  meet  not
so  often  with  oppositions,  or,  at  least,  are  not  usually  so  ill  re
sented  by  men  that  think  otherwise,  as  discommendations  ;  and
you  will  insinuate  into  men's  favour  by  nothing  sooner  than  seem
ing  to  approve  and  commend  what  they  like  ;  but  beware  o
doing  it  by  comparison.  5.  If  you  be  affronted,  it  is  better,  in  c
foreign  country,  to  pass  it  by  in  silence,  and  with  a  jest,  though
with  some  dishonour,  than  to  endeavour  revenge  ;  for,  in  the  first
case,  your  credit's  ne'er  the  worse  when  you  return  into  England,
or  come  into  other  company  that  have  not  heard  of  the  quarrel.
But,  in  the  second  case,  you  may  bear  the  marks  of  the  quarrel
while  you  live,  if  you  outlive  it  at  all.  But,  if  you  find  yoursell
unavoidably  engaged,  'tis  best,  I  think,  if  you  can  command  your
passion  and  language,  to  keep  them  pretty  evenly  at  some  certain
moderate  pitch,  not  much  heightening  them  to  exasperate  your
adversary,  or  provoke  his  friends,  nor  letting  them  grow  overmuch
dejected  to  make  him  insult.  In  a  word,  if  you  can  keep  reason
above  passion,  that  and  watchfulness  will  be  your  best  defendants.
To  which  purpose  you  may  consider,  that,  though  such  excuses
is  this — He  provok't  me  so  much  I  could  not  forbear — may  pass

among  friends,  yet   amongst  strangers  they  are  insignificant,  ina
only  argue  a  traveller's  weakness.
"  To  these  I  may  add  some  general  heads  for  inquiries  or  ob
servations,  such  as  at  present  I  can  think  on.  As,  1.  To  observe
the  policies,  wealth,  and  state  affairs  of  nations,  so  far  as  a  soli-
fary  traveller  may  conveniently  do.  2.  Their  impositions  upon
all  sorts  of  people,  trades,  or  commodities,  that  are  remarkable.
3.  Their  laws  and  customs,  how  far  they  differ  from  ours.  4.
Their  trades  and  arts  wherein  they  excel  or  come  short  of  us  in
England.  5.  Such  fortifications  as  you  shall  meet  with,  their
fashion,  strength,  and  advantages  for  defence,  and  other  such  mili
tary  affairs  as  are  considerable.  6.  The  power  and  respect  be
longing  to  their  degrees  of  nobility  or  magistracy.  7.  It  will  not
be  time  misspent  to  make  a  catalogue  of  the  names  and  excellen
cies  of  those  men  that  are  most  wise,  learned,  or  esteemed  in  any
nation.  8.  Observe  the  mechanism  and  manner  of  guiding  ships.
9.  Observe  the  products  of  Nature  in  several  places,  especially  in
mines,  with  the  circumstances  of  mining  and  of  extracting  metals
or  minerals   out  of  their  ore,  and  of  refining  them  ;  and  if  you
meet  with   any  transmutations   out    of  their  own    species    into
another  (as  out  of  iron  into  copper,  out  of  any  metal  into  quick
silver,  out  of  one  salt  into  another,  or  into  an  insipid  body,  &c.),
those,  above  all,  will  be  worth  your  noting,  being  the  most  lucif-
erous,  and  many  times  lucriferous  experiments,  too,  in  philosophy.
10.  The   prices   of  diet   and  other  things.      11.  And  the  staple
commodities  of  places.
"  These  generals  (such  as  at  present  I  could  think  of),  if  they
will  serve  for  nothing  else,  yet  they  may  assist  you  in  drawing  up
a  model  to  regulate  your  travels  by.  '  As  for  particulars,  these  that
follow  are  all  that  1  can  now  think  of,  viz.  ;  whether  at  Schem-
nitium,  in  Hungary  (where  there  are  mines  of  gold,  copper,  iron,
vitriol,  antimony,  &c.).  they  change  iron  into  copper  by  dissolving
»t  in  a  vitriolate  water,  which  they  find  in  cavities  of  rocks  in  the
mines,  and  then  melting  the  slimy  solution  in  a  stroi  ig  fire,  which
in  the  cooling  proves  copper.  The  like  is  said  to  be  done  in  other
places,  which  I  cannot  now  remember  ;  perhaps,  too,  it  may  be
lone  in  Italy.  For  about  twenty  or  thirty  years  agone  there  was
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,   21
a  certain  vitriol  came  from  thence  (called  Roman  vitriol),  but  of
a  nobler  virtue  than  that  which  is  now  called  by  that  name  ;
which  vitriol  is  not  now  to  be  gotten,  because,  perhaps,  they  make
a  greater  gain  by  some  such  trick  as  turning  iron  into  copper
with  it  than  by  selling  it.  2.  Whether,  in  Hungary,  Sclavonia,
Bohemia,  near  the  town  Eila,  or  at  the  mountains  of  Bohemia
near  Silesia,  there  be  rivers  whose  waters  are  impregnated  with
gold  ;  perhaps,  the  gold  being  dissolved  by  some  corrosive  water
like  aqua  regis,  and  the  solution  carried  along  with  the  stream,
that  runs  through  the  mines.  And  whether  the  practice  of  laying
mercury  in  the  rivers,  till  it  be  tinged  with  gold,  and  then  strain
ing  the  mercury  through  leather,  that  the  gold  may  stay  behind,
be  a  secret  yet,  or  openly  practised.  3.  There  is  newly  con
trived,  in  Holland,  a  mill  to  grind  glasses  plane  withal,  and  I
think  polishing  them  too  ;  perhaps  it  will  be  worth  the  while  to  see
it.     4.  There  is  in  Holland  one     Borry,  who  some  years  since
was  imprisoned  by  the  Pope,  to  have  extorted  from  him  secrets
(as  I  am  told)  of  great  worth,  both  as  to  medicine  and  profit,  but
he  escaped  into  Holland,  where  they  have  granted  him  a  guard.
I  think  he  usually  goes  clothed  in  green.  Pray  inquire  what  you
can  of  him,  and  whether  his  ingenuity  be  any  profit  to  the  Dutch.
You  may  inform  yourself  whether  the  Dutch  have  any  tricks  to
keep  their  ships  from  being  all  worm-eaten  in  their  voyages  to
the  Indies.  Whether  pendulum  clocks  do  any  service  in  finding
out  the  longitude,  &c.
"  I  am  very  weary,  and  shall  not  stay  to  part  with  a  long
compliment,  only  I  wish  you  a  good  journey,  and  God  be  with
you." It  was  not  till  the  month  of  June,  1669,  that  our  author  made
known  his  Method  of  Fluxions.  He  then  communicated  the
work  which  he  had  composed  upon  the  subject,  and  entitled,
ANALYSIS  PER  EQUATIONES  NUMERO  TERMINORUM  INFINITAS,
to  his  friend  Dr.  Barrow.  The  latter,  in  a  letter  dated  20th  of  the
same  month,  mentioned  it  to  Mr.  Collins,  and  transmitted  it  to
him,  on  the  31st  of  July  thereafter.  Mr.  Collins  greatly  approv>
ed  of  the  work  ;  took  a  copy  of  it ;  and  sent  the  original  back
to  Dr.  Barrow.  During  the  same  and  the  two  following  years,  Mr
<   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
Collins,  by  his  extensive  correspondence,  spread  the  knowledge
of  this  discovery  among  the  mathematicians  in  England,  Scotland,
France,  Holland  and  Italy.
Dr.  Barrow,  having  resolved  to  devote  himself  to  Theology,
resigned  the  Lucasian  Professorship  of  Mathematics,  in  1669,  in
favour  of  Newton,  who  accordingly  received  the  appointment  to
the  vacant  chair.
During  the  years  1669,  1670,  and  1671,  our  author,  as  such
Professor,  delivered  a  course  of  Optical  Lectures.  Though  these
contained  his  principal  discoveries  relative  to  the  different  re-
frangibility  of  light,  yet  the  discoveries  themselves  did  not  be
come  publicly  known,  it  seems,  till  he  communicated  them  to  the
Royal  Society,  a  few  weeks  after  being  elected  a  member  there
of,  in  the  spring  of  1671-2.  He  now  rose  rapidly  in  reputation,
and  was  soon  regarded  as  foremost  among  the  philosophers  of  the
age.  His  paper  on  light  excited  the  deepest  interest  in  the  Royal
Society,  who  manifested  an  anxious  solicitude  to  secure  the  author
from  the  "  arrogations  of  others,"  and  proposed  to  publish  his
discourse  in  the  monthly  numbers  in  which  the  Transactions  were
given  to  the  world.  Newton,  gratefully  sensible  of  these  expres
sions  of  esteem,  willingly  accepted  of  the  proposal  for  publication.
He  gave  them  also,  at  this  time,  the  results  of  some  further  ex
periments  in  the  decomposition  and  re-composition  of  light : — that
the  same  degree  of  refrangibility  always  belonged  to  the  same
colour,  and  the  same  colour  to  the  same  degree  of  refrangibility  :
that  the  seven  different  colours  of  the  spectrum  were  original,  or
simple,  and  that  whiteness^  or  white  light  was  a  compound  of  all
these  seven  colours.
The  publication  of  his  new  doctrines  on  light  soon  called  forth
violent  opposition  as  to  their  soundness.  Hooke  and  Huygens —
men  eminent  for  ability  and  learning — were  the  most  conspicuous
of  the  assailants.  And  though  Newton  effectually  silenced  all  his
adversaries,  yet  he  felt  the  triumph  of  little  gain  in  comparison
.vith  the  loss  his  tranquillity  had  sustained.  He  subsequently  re-
narked  in  allusion  to  this  controversy — and  to  one  with  whom
he  was  destined  to  have  a  longer  and  a  bitterer  conflict —  "  I  was
so  persecuted  with  discussions  arising  from  the  publication  of  m  v

theory  ot  light,  that  I  blamed  my  own  imprudence  for  parting
with  so  substantial  a  blessing  as  rny  quiet  to  run  after  a  shadow.7'
In  a  communication  to  Mr.  Oldenburg,  Secretary  of  the  Royal
Society,  in  1672,  our  author  stated  many  valuable  suggestions  re
lative  to  the  construction  of  REFLECTING  MICROSCOPES  which  he
considered  even  more  capable  of  improvement  than  telescopes.
He  also  contemplated,  about  the  same  time,  an  edition  of  Kirick-
huysen's  Algebra,  with  notes  and  additions;  partially  arranging,
as  an  introduction  to  the  work,  a  treatise,  entitled,  A  Method  of
Fluxions  ;  but  he  finally  abandoned  the  design.  This  treatise,
however,  he  resolved,  or  rather  consented,  at  a  late  period  of  his
life,  to  put  forth  separately  ;  and  the  plan  would  probably  have
been  carried  into  execution  had  riot  his  death  intervened.  It  was
translated  into  English,  and  published  in  1736  by  John  Colson,
Professor  of  Mathematics  in  Cambridge.
Newton,  it  is  thought,  made  his  discoveries  concerning  the
INFLECTION  and  DIFFRACTION  of  light  before  1674.  The  phe
nomena  of  the  inflection  of  light  had  been  first  discovered  more
than  ten  years  before  by  Grimaldi.  And  Newton  began  by  re
peating  one  of  the  experiments  of  the  learned  Jesuit — admitting
a  beam  of  the  sun's  light  through  a  small  pin  hole  into  a  dark
chamber  :  the  light  diverged  from  the  aperture  in  the  form  of  a,
cone,  and  the  shadows  of  all  bodies  placed  in  this  light  were
larger  than  might  have  been  expected,  and  surrounded  with  three
coloured  fringes,  the  nearest  being  widest,  and  the  most  remote
the  narrowest.  Newton,  advancing  upon  this  experiment,  took
exact  measures  of  the  diameter  of  the  shadow  of  a  human  hair,
and  of  the  breadth  of  the  fringes,  at  different  distances  behind  it,
and  discovered  that  these  diameters  and  breadths  were  not  pro
portional  to  the  distances  at  which  they  were  measured.  He
hence  supposed  that  the  rays  which  passed  by  the  edge  of  the
hair  were  deflected  or  turned  aside  from  it,  as  if  by  a  repulsive
force,  the  nearest  rays  suffering  the  greatest,  the  more  remote  a
less  degree  of  deflection.  In  explanation  of  the  coloured  fringes,
he  queried  :  whether  the  rays  which  differ  in  refrangibility  do  not
differ  also  in  flexibility,  and  whether  they  are  n<»t,  by  these  dif
ferent  inflections,  separated  from  one  another,  so  as  after  separa-

tion  to  make  the  colours  in  the  three  fringes  above  described  ?
Also,  whether  the  rays,  in  passing  by  the  edges  and  sides  ol
bodies,  are  not  bent  several  times  backwards  and  forwards  with
an  eel-like  motion — the  three  fringes  arising  from  three  such
bendings  ?  His  inquiries  on  this  subject  were  here  interrupted
and  fiever  renewed.
His  Theory  of  the  COLOURS  of  NATURAL  BODIES  was  commu
nicated  to  the  Royal  Society,  in  February,  1675.  This  is  justly
regarded  as  one  of  the  profoundest  of  his  speculations.  The  fun
damental  principles  of  the  Theory  in  brief,  are  : — That  bodies
possessing  the  greatest  refractive  powers  reflect  the  greatest
quantity  of  light ;  and  that,  at  the  confines  of  equally  refracting
media,  there  is  no  reflection.  That  the  minutest  particles  of  al
most  all  natural  bodies  are  in  some  degree  transparent.  That
between  the  particles  of  bodies  there  are  pores,  or  spaces,  either
empty  or  filled  with  media  of  a  less  density  than  the  particles
themselves.  That  these  particles,  and  pores  or  spaces,  have  some
definite  size.  Hence  he  deduced  the  Transparency,  Opacity,  and
colours  of  natural  bodies.  Transparency  arises  from  the  particles
and  their  pores  being  too  small  to  cause  reflection  at  their  com
mon  surfaces — the  light  all  passing  through  ;  Opacity  from  the
opposite  cause  of  the  particles  and  their  pores  being  sufficiently
large  to  reflect  the  light  which  is  "  stopped  or  stifled7'  by  the
multitude  of  reflections  ;  and  colours  from  the  particles,  accord
ing  to  their  several  sizes,  reflecting  rays  of  one  colour  and  trans
mitting  those  of  another — or  in  other  words,  the  colour  that
meets  the  eye  is  the  colour  reflected,  while  all  the  other  rays  are
transmitted  or  absorbed.
Analogous  in  origin  to  the  colours  of  natural  bodies,  he  con
sidered  the  COLOURS  OF  THIN  PLATES.  This  subject  was  interest
ing  and  important,  and  had  attracted  considerable  investigation.
He,  however,  was  the  first  to  determine  the  law  of  the  produc
tion  of  these  colours,  arid,  during  the  same  year  made  known  the
results  of  his  researches  herein  to  the  Royal  Society.  His  mode
of  procedure  in  these  experiments  was  simple  and  curious.  He
placed  a  double  convex  lens  of  a  large  known  radius  of  curvature,
the  flat  surface  of  a  plano-convex  object  glass.  Thus,  from
UFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   25
their  point  of  contact  at  the  centre,  to  the  circumference  of  the
lens,  he  obtained  plates  of  air,  or  spaces  varying  from  the  ex-
tremest  possible  thinness,  by  slow  degrees,  to  a  considerable  thick
ness.  Letting  the  light  fall,  every  different  thickness  of  this
plate  of  air  gave  different  colours — the  point  of  contact  of  the
lens  and  glass  forming  the  centre  of  numerous  concentric  colored
nags.  Now  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the  lens  being  known,  the
thickness  of  the  plate  of  air,  at  any  given  point,  or  where  any  par
ticular  colour  appeared,  could  be  exactly  determined.  Carefully
noting,  therefore,  the  order  in  which  the  different  colours  ap
peared,  he  measured,  with  the  nicest  accuracy,  the  different  thick*
nesses  at  which  the  most  luminous  parts  of  the  rings  were  pro
duced,  whether  the  medium  were  air,  water,  or  mica —  all  these
substances  giving  the  same  colours  at  different  thicknesses  ; — the
ratio  of  which  he  also  ascertained.  From  the  phenomena  obser
ved  in  these  experiments,  Newton  deduced  his  Theory  of  Fits  of
EASY  REFLECTION  AND  TRANSMISSION  of  light.  It  consists  in  suppos
ing  that  every  particle  of  light,  from  its  first  discharge  from  a  lumi
nous  body,  possesses,  at  equally  distant  intervals,  dispositions  to
be  reflected  from,  or  transmitted  through  the  surfaces  of  bodies
upon  which  it  may  fall.  For  instance,  if  the  rays  are  in  a  Fit  of
Easy  Reflection,  they  are  on  reaching  the  surface,  repelled,
thrown  off]  or  reflected  from  it ;  if,  in  a  Fit  of  Easy  Transmission,
they  are  attracted,  drawn  in,  or  transmitted  through  it.  By  this
Theory  of  Fits,  our  author  likewise  explained  the  colours  of
thick  plates.
He  regarded  light  as  consisting  of  small  material  particles
emitted  from  shining  substances.  He  thought  that  these  parti
cles  could  be  re-combined  into  solid  matter,  so  that  "  gross  bodies
and  light,  were  convertible  into  one  another  ;"  that  the  particles  of
light  and  the  particles  of  solid  bodies  acted  mutually  upon  each
other  ;  those  of  light  agitating  and  heating  those  of  solid  bodies,
and  the  latter  attracting  and  repelling  the  former.  Newton  was
the  first  to  suggest  the  idea  of  the  POLARIZATION  of  light.
In  the  paper  entitled  An  Hypothesis  Explaining  Properties  of
Light,  December,  1675,  our  author  first  introduced  his  opinions  re
specting  Ether — opinions  which  he  afterward  abandoned  and  again
26   LIFE    OF    SIR      S.\AC    1SEWTON.
permanently  resumed —  "  A  most  subtle  spirit  which  pervades"  ah
bodies,  and  is  expanded  through  all  the  heavens.  It  is  electric,
and  almost,  if  not  quite  immeasurably  elastic  and  rare.  "  By  the
force  and  action  of  which  spirit  the  particles  of  bodies  mutually
attract  one  another,  at  near  distances,  and  cohere,  if  contiguous  ;
and  electric  bodies  operate  at  greater  distances,  as  well  repelling
as  attracting  the  neighbouring  corpuscles  ;  and  light  is  emitted,
-reflected,  refracted,  inflected  and  heats  bodies  ;  and  all  sensation
is  excited,  and  the  members  of  animal  bodies  move  at  the  com
mand  of  the  will,  namely,  by  the  vibrations  of  this  spirit,  mutu
ally  propagated  along  the  solid  filaments  of  the  nerves,  from  the
outward  organs  of  sense  to  the  brain,  and  from  the  brain  into  the
muscles."  This  "  spirit"  was  no  anima  mundi  ;  nothing  further
from  the  thought  of  Newton  ;  but  was  it  not,  on  his  part,  a  par
tial  recognition  of,  or  attempt  to  reach  an  ultimate  material  force,
or  primary  element,  by  means  of  which,  "  in  the  roaring  loom  of
time,"  this  material  universe,  God's  visible  garment,  may  be
woven  for  us  ?
The  Royal  Society  were  greatly  interested  in  the  results  of
some  experiments,  which  our  author  had,  at  the  same  time,  com
municated  to  them  relative  to  the  excitation  of  electricity  in  glass  ;
and  they,  after  several  attempts  and  further  direction  from  him,
succeeded  in  re-producing  the  same  phenomena.
One  of  the  most  curious  of  Newton's  minor  inquiries  related  to
the  connexion  between  the  refractive  powers  and  chemical  com
position  of  bodies.  He  found  on  comparing  the  refractive  powers
and  the  densities  of  many  different  substances,  that  the  former
were  very  nearly  proportional  to  the  latter,  in  the  same  bodies.
Unctuous  and  sulphureous  bodies  were  noticed  as  remarkable  excep
tions — as  well  as  the  diamond — their  refractive  powers  being  two
or  three  times  greater  in  respect  of  their  densities  than  in  the
case  of  other  substances,  while,  as  among  themselves,  the  one  was
generally  proportional  to  the  other.  He  hence  inferred  as  to  the
diamond  a  great  degree  of  combustibility  •; — a  conjecture  which
the  experiments  of  modern  chemistry  have  shown  to  be  true.
The  chemical  researches  of  our  author  were  probably  pursued
with  more  or  less  diligence  from  the  time  of  his  witnessing  some

?t'  the  uractical  operations  in  that  science  at  the  Apothecary's  at
Grantham.     DE  NATURA  ACIDORUM  is  a  short  chemical  paper,  on
various   topics,   and  published   in  Dr.   Horsley's  Edition  of  his
works.     TABULA  QUANTITATUM  E  r  GRADUUM  COLORIS  was  in
serted  iii  the  Philosophical  Transactions  ;  it  contains  a  compara
tive  scale  of  temperature  from  that  of  melting  ice  to  that  of  a
small  kitchen  coal-fire.     He  regarded  fire  as  a  body  heated  so  hot
as  to  emit  light  copiously  ;  and  flame  as  a  vapour,  fume,  or  ex
halation  heated   so  hot  as  to  shine.     To  elective  attraction,  by
the  operation  of  which  the  small  particles  of  bodies,  as  he  con
ceived,  act  upon  one  another,  at  distances  so  minute  as  to  escape
observation,  he  ascribed  all  the   various   chemical  phenomena  ot
precipitation,  combination,  solution,  and   crystallization,   and   the
mechanical  phenomena  of  cohesion  and  capillary  attraction.    New
ton's  chemical  views  were   illustrated  and  confirmed,  in  part,  at
least,  in  his  own  life-time.     As  to  the  structure  of  bodies,  he  was
of  opinion  "  that  the  smallest  particles  of  matter   may  cohere  by
the  strongest  attractions,  and  compose  bigger  particles  of  weaker
virtue  ;  and  many  of  these  may  cohere  and  compose  bigger  par
tides  whose  virtue  is  still  weaker  ;  and  so  on  for  divers  succes
sions,  until  the  progression  end  in  the  biggest  particles,  on  which
the  operations  in  chemistry  and  the  colours  of  natural  bodies  de
pend,  and  which  by  adhering,  compose  bodies  of  sensible  magni
tude."
There  is  good  reason  to  suppose  that  our  author  was  a  diligent
student  of  the  writings  of  Jacob  Behmen  ;  and  that  in  conjunction
with  a  relative,  Dr.  Newton,  he  was  busily  engaged,  for  several
months  in  the  earlier  part  of  life,  in  quest  of  the  philosopher's
tincture.  "  Great  Alchymist,"  however,  very  imperfectly  de
scribes  the  character  of  Behmen,  whose  researches  into  things
material  and  things  spiritual,  things  human  and  things  divine,  ai-
ford  the  strongest  evidence  of  a  great  and  original  mind.
More  appropriately  here,  perhaps,  than  elsewhere,  may  be
given  Newton's  account  of  some  curious  experiments,  made  in  his
own  person,  on  the  action  of  light  upon  the  retina,  Locke,  who
was  an  intimate  friend  of  our  author,  wrote  to  him  for  his  opinion
on  a  certain  fact  stated  in  Boyle's  Book  of  Colours.  Newton,  in
2S   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
his  reply,  dated  June  30th,  16(Jl,  narrates  the  following  circum
stances,  which  probably  took  place  in  the  course  of  his  optical
researches.  Thus  : —
"  The  observation  you  mention  in  Mr.  Boyle's  Book  of  Colours
I  once  tried  upon  myself  with  the  hazard  of  my  eyes.  The
manner  was  this ;  I  looked  a  very  little  while  upon  the  sun  in  the
looking-glass  with  my  right  eye,  and  then  turned  my  eyes  into  a
dark  corner  of  my  chamber,  arid  winked,  to  observe  the  impres
sion  made,  and  the  circles  of  colours  which  encompassed  it,  and
how  they  decayed  by  degrees,  and  at  last  vanished.  This  I  re
peated  a  second  and  a  third  time.  At  the  third  time,  when  the
phantasm  of  light  and  colours  about  it  were  almost  vanished,  in
tending  my  fancy  upon  them  to  see  their  last  appearance,  I  found,
to  my  amazement,  that  they  began  to  return,  and  by  little  and
little  to  become  as  lively  and  vivid  as  when  I  had  newly  looked
upon  the  sun.  But  when  I  ceased  to  intend  my  fancy  upon  them,
they  vanished  again.  After  this,  I  found,  that  as  often  as  I  went
into  the  dark,  and  intended  my  mind  upon  them,  as  when  a  man
looks  earnestly  to  see  anything  which  is  difficult  to  be  seen,  I
could  make  the  phantasm  return  without  looking  any  more  upon
the  sun  ;  and  the  oftener  I  made  it  return,  the  more  easily  I  could
make  it  return  again.  And,  at  length,  by  repeating  this,  without
looking  any  more  upon  the  sun,  I  made  such  an  impression  on  my
eye,  that,  if  I  looked  upon  the  clouds,  or  a  book,  or  any  bright
object,  I  saw  upon  it  a  round  bright  spot  of  light  like  the  sun,
and,  which  is  still  stranger,  though  I  looked  upon  the  sun  with
my  right  eye  only,  and  not  with  my  left,  yet  my  fancy  began  *o
make  an  impression  upon  my  left  eye,  as  well  us  upon  my  right.
For  if  I  shut  my  right  eye,  or  looked  upon  a  book,  or  the  clouds,
with  my  left  eye,  I  could  see  the  spectrum  of  the  sun  almost  as
plain  as  with  my  right  eye,  if  I  did  but  intend  my  fancy  a  little
while  upon  it ;  for  at  first,  if  I  shut  my  right  eye,  and  looked  with
my  left,  the  spectrum  of  the  sun  did  not  appear  till  I  intended  my
fancy  upon  it ;  but  by  repeating,  this  appeared  every  time  more
easily.  And  now,  in  a  few  hours'  time,  I  had  brought  my  eyes
to  such  a  pass,  that  I  could  look  upon  no  blight  object  with  either
eye,  but  I  saw  the  sun  before  me,  so  that  I  durst  neither  write
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   29
nor  read  ;  but  to  recover  the  use  of  my  eyes,  shut  myself  up  in
my  chamber  made  dark,  for  three  days  together,  and  used  all
means  to  divert  my  imagination  from  the  sun.  For  if  I  thought
upon  him,  I  presently  saw  his  picture,  though  I  was  in  the  dark.
But  by  keeping  in  the  dark,  and  employing  my  mind  about  other
things,  I  began  in  three  or  four  days  to  have  some  use  of  my  eyes
again ;  and  by  forbearing  to  look  upon  bright  objects,  recovered
them  pretty  well,  though  not  so  well  but  that,  for  some  months
after,  the  spectrum  of  the  sun  began  to  return  as  often  as  I  began
to  meditate  upon  the  phenomena,  even  though  I  lay  in  bed  at  mid
night  with  my  curtains  drawn.  But  now  I  have  been  very  well
for  many  years,  though  I  am  apt  to  think,  if  I  durst  venture  my
eyes,  I  could  still  make  the  phantasm  return  by  the  power  of  my
fancy.  This  story  I  tell  you,  to  let  you  understand,  thaj;  in  the
observation  related  by  Mr.  Boyle,  the  man's  fancy  probably  con
curred  with  the  impression  made  by  the  sun's  light  to  produce
that  phantasm  of  the  sun  which  he  constantly  saw  in  bright  ob
jects.  And  so  your  question  about  the  cause  of  phantasm  in
volves  another  about  the  power  of  fancy,  which  I  must  confess  is
too  hard  a  knot  for  me  to  untie.  To  place  this  effect  in  a  constant
motion  is  hard,  because  the  sun  ought  then  to  appear  perpetually.
It  seems  rather  to  consist  in  a  disposition  of  the  sensorium  to
move  the  imagination  strongly,  and  to  be  easily  moved,  both  by
the  imagination  and  by  the  light,  as  often  as  bright  objects  are
looked  upon."J
Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
to  speak,  in  the  garden  at  Woolsthorpe,  years  ago,  had  gradually
expanded  upon  him.  We  find  him,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Hooke,
Secretary  of  the  Royal  Society,  dated  in  November,  1679,  pro
posing  to  verify  the  motion  of  the  earth  by  direct  experiment,
namely,  by  the  observation  of  the  path  pursued  by  a  body  falling
from  a  considerable  height.  He  had  concluded  that  the  path
would  be  spiral ;  but  Dr.  Hooke  maintained  that  it  would  be  an
eccentric  ellipse  iu  vacuo,

A  stirring  freshness  in  the  air,  and  ruddy  streaks  upon  the

Its  dignity  is,  and  will  yet  be  held  commensurate  with  its  duty —
a  duty  boundless  as  man's  intellectual  capacity,  and  great  as  his

will,  as  time  flows  into  eternity  and  space  into  infinity,  roll  up,  a
measureless  curse  or  a  measureless  blessing,  in  inconceivable

esteemed  of  even  sacred  import  in  this  country.  Ere  long  a  hun

INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  AMERICAN  EDITION.
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat
remarkable  fact  ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
the  very  elements  of  science,  is  revered  at  every  hearth-stone
where  knowledge  and  virtue  are  of  chief  esteem,  while,  abroad,
in  all  the  high  places  of  the  land,  the  character  which  that  name
recalls  is  held  up  as  the  noblest  illustration  of  what  MAN  may  be,
and  may  do,  in  the  possession  and  manifestation  of  pre-eminent
intellectual  and  moral  worth  ;  because  the  work  is  celebrated,  not
only  in  the  history  of  one  career  and  one  mind,  but  in  the  history
of  all  achievement  and  human  reason  itself;  because  of  the  spirit
of  inquiry,  which  has  been  aroused,  and  which,  in  pursuing  its
searchings,  is  not  always  satisfied  with  stopping  short  of  the  foun
tain-head  of  any  given  truth  ;  and,  finally,  because  of  the  earnest
endeavour  that  has  been  and  is  constantly  going  on,  in  many
sections  of  the  Republic,  to  elevate  the  popular  standard  of  edu
cation  and  give  to  scientific  and  other  efforts  a  higher  and  a
better  aim.
True,  the  PRINCIPIA  has  been  hitherto  inaccessible  to  popular
use.  A  few  copies  in  Latin,  and  occasionally  one  in  English  may
be  found  in  some  of  our  larger  libraries,  or  in  the  possession  of
some  ardent  disciple  of  the  great  Master.  But  a  d^ad  language
in  the  one  case,  and  an  enormous  price  in  both,  particularly  in
that  of  the  English  edition,  have  thus  far  opposed  very  sufficient
obstacles  to  the  wide  circulation  of  the  work.  It  is  now,  how
ever,  placed  within  the  reach  of  all.  And  in  performing  this  la
bour,  the  utmost  care  has  been  taken,  by  collation,  revision,  and
otherwise,  to  render  the  First  American  Edition  the  most  accurate
and  beautiful  in  our  language.  u  Le  plus  beau  monument  que

set  up.  The  PRINCIPIA,  above  all,  glows  with  the  immortality  of
a  transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass  away  ;
but  the  true  creations  of  genius  endure,  in  time  and  beyond  time,
forever  :  high  upon  the  adamant  of  the  indestructible,  they  send
forth  afar  and  near,  over  the  troublous  waters  of  life,  a  pure,  un
wavering,  quenchless  light  whereby  the  myriad  myriads  of  barques,
richly  laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are
guided  through  the  night  and  the  storm,  by  the  beetling  shore
and  the  hidden  rock,  the  breaker  and  the  shoal,  safely  into  havens
calm  and  secure.
To  the  teacher  and  the  taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the
devotee  of  Science  and  the  worshipper  of  Truth,  the  PRINCIPIA
must  ever  continue  to  be  of  inestimable  value.  If  to  educate
means,  not  so  much  to  store  the  memory  with  symbols  and  facts,
as  to  bring  forth  the  faculties  of  the  soul  and  develope  them  to  the
full  by  healthy  nurture  and  a  hardy  discipline,  then,  what  so  effec
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed,
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions,
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer
ence,  so  strongly  marked,  is  not  to  be  reckoned  a  mere  matter  oi
taste  ;  and  his  authority  should  bear  with  preponderating  weight
upon  the  decision  of  every  instructor  in  adopting  what  may  be
deemed  the  best  plan  to  insure  the  completes!  mental  develop

view,  the  outward  form  of  that  Inner  Harmony  of  which  and  in
which  all  things  are.  Plainly,  therefore,  this  noble  study  has
other  and  infinitely  higher  uses  than  to  increase  the  power  of  ab
straction.  A  more  general  and  thorough  cultivation  of  it  should
oe  strenuously  insisted  on.  Passing  from  the  pages  of  Euclid  or
Legendre,  might  not  the  student  be  led,  at  the  suitable  time,  to
those  of  the  PRINCIPIA  wherein  Geometry  may  be  found  in  varied
use  from  the  familiar  to  the  sublime  ?  The  profoundest  and  the
happiest  results,  it  is  believed,  would  attend  upon  this  enlargement
of  our  Educational  System.

great  and  pure  spirit  of  its  author,  will  go  forth  from  the  scenes
of  their  pupilage,  and  take  their  places  in  the  world  as  strong-
minded,  right-hearted  men — such  men  as  the  Theory  of  our
Government  contemplates  and  its  practical  operation  absolutely
demands.
LIFE  OF
SIE  ISAAC  NEWTON.
Nec  fas  est  proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY.
FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and
moral  truth  ;  ascending  height  after  height  ;  sweeping  afar  over
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment  ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose,
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect
God.
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain,
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness,
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise
decreed  !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies."
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire,
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred
years  before  this  memorable  birth.
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum,
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years,
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care
of  her  own  mother.
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development  ;
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character.
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran-
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary.
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no
charms  for  him  ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe  kick  in  the  stomach  ;  Isaac,
deeply  affected,  but  with  no  outburst  of  passion,  betook  himself,
with  quiet,  incessant  toil,  to  his  books  ;  he  quickly  passed  above
the  offending  classmate  ;  yet  there  he  stopped  not  ;  the  strong
spirit  was,  for  once  and  forever,  awakened,  and,  yielding  to  itb
noble  impulse,  he  speedily  took  up  his  position  at  the  head  of  all.
His  peculiar  character  began  now  rapidly  to  unfold  itself.
Close  application  grew  to  be  habitual.  Observation  alternated
with  reflection.  "  A  sober,  silent,  thinking  lad,"  yet,  the  wisest
and  the  kindliest,  the  indisputable  leader  of  his  fellows.  Gener-

osity,  modesty,  and  a  love  of  truth  distinguished  him  then  as  ever
afterwards.  He  did  not  often  join  his  classmates  in  play  ;  but  he
would  contrive  for  them  various  amusements  of  a  scientific  kind.
Paper  kites  he  introduced  ;  carefully  determining  their  best  form
and  proportions,  and  the  position  and  number  of  points  whereby
to  attach  the  string.  He  also  invented  paper  lanterns  ;  these
served  ordinarily  to  guide  the  way  to  school  in  winter  mornings,
but  occasionally  for  quite  another  purpose  ;  they  were  attached  to
the  tails  of  kites  in  a  dark  night,  to  the  dismay  of  the  country  people
dreading  portentous  comets,  and  to  the  immeasureable  delight  ol
his  companions.  To  him,  however,  young  as  he  was,  life  seemed
to  have  become  an  earnest  thing.  When  not  occupied  with  his
studies,  his  mind  would  be  engrossed  with  mechanical  contrivances  ;
now  imitating,  now  inventing.  He  became  singularly  skilful  in  the
use  of  his  little  saws,  hatchets,  hammers,  and  other  tools.  A
windmill  was  erected  near  Grantham  ;  during  the  operations  ol
the  workmen,  he  was  frequently  present  ;  in  a  short  time,  he  had
completed  a  perfect  working  model  of  it,  which  elicited  general
admiration.  Not  content,  however,  with  this  exact  imitation,  he
conceived  the  idea  of  employing,  in  the  place  of  sails,  animal  power  ,
and,  adapting  the  construction  of  his  mill  accordingly,  he  enclosed
in  it  a  mouse,  called  the  miller,  and  which  by  acting  on  a  sort  ot
treadvvheel,  gave  motion  to  the  machine.  He  invented,  too,  a
mechanical  carriage — having  four  wheels,  and  put  in  motion  with
a  handle  worked  by  the  person  sitting  inside.  The  measurement
of  time  early  drew  his  attention.  He  h'rst  constructed  a  water
clock,  in  proportions  somewhat  like  an  old-fashioned  house  clock.
The  index  of  the  dial  plate  was  turned  by  a  piece  of  wood  acted
upon  by  dropping  water.  This  instrument,  though  long  used  by
himself,  and  by  Mr.  Clark's  family,  did  not  satisfy  his  inquiring
mind.  His  thoughts  rose  to  the  sun  ;  and,  by  careful  and  oft-re
peated  observations  of  the  solar  movements,  he  subsequently
formed  many  dials.  One  of  these,  named  Isaac's  dial,  was  the
accurate  result  of  years'  labour,  and  was  frequently  referred  to
for  the  hour  of  the  day  by  the  country  people.
May  we  not  discern  in  these  continual  efforts — the  diligent  re
search^  the  patient  meditation,  the  aspiring  glance,  and  the  energy
12   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.
of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit,
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si
lently  conquering.
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures,
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn,
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated,
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe  ;  but
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham.
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed,
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion  ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and
kindness.
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she,
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When  sent  to
Grantham  Market  on  Saturdays,  he  would  betake  himself  to  his
former  lodgings  in  the  apothecary's  garret,  where  some  of  Mr.
Clark's  old  books  employed  his  thoughts  till  the  aged  and  trust
worthy  servant  had  executed  the  family  commissions  and  announced
the  necessity  of  return  :  or,  at  other  times,  our  young  philosopher
would  seat  himself  under  a  hedge,  by  the  wayside,  and  continue
his  studies  till  the  same  faithful  personage — proceeding  alone  to
the  town  and  completing  the  day's  business — stopped  as  he  re-
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,   13
turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College,
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted.
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age.
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider
field  ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success.
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them
many  comments  ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed  than  his  tutor
in  many  branches  of  learning.  Yet  his  acquisitions  were  not
gotten  with  the  rapidity  of  intuition  ;  but  they  were  thoroughly
made  and  firmly  secured.  Quickness  of  apprehension,  or  Intel
lectual  nimbleness  did  not  belong  to  him.  He  saw  too  far  :  his,
insight  was  too  deep.  He  dwelt  fully,  cautiously  upon  the  least
subject  ;  while  to  the  consideration  of  the  greatest,  he  brought  a
massive  strength  joined  with  a  matchless  clearness,  that,  regard
less  of  the  merely  trivial  or  unimportant,  bore  with  unerring  sa
gacity  upon  the  prominences  of  the  subject,  and,  grappling  with
its  difficulties,  rarely  failed  to  surmount  them.
14   LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON
His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669.
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ;
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science,
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation  ;  among  the
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria  ;  among  the
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis.
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la-
hours  of  his  predecessors  :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines
as  generated  by  the  motion  of  points,  surfaces  by  the  motion  of
lines,  and  solids  by  the  motion  of  surfaces,  and  considering  that
the  ordinates,  abscissae,  &c.,  of  curves  thus  formed,  vary  accord
ing  to  a  regular  law  depending  on  the  equation  of  the  curve,
he  deduced  from  this  equation  the  velocities  with  which  these
quantities  are  generated,  and  obtained  by  the  rules  of  infinite
series,  the  ultimate  value  required.  To  the  velocities  with  which
every  line  or  quantity  is  generated,  he  gave  the  name  of  FLUX
IONS,  and  to  the  lines  or  quantities  themselves,  that  of  FLUENTS.
A  discovery  that  successively  baffled  the  acutest  and  strongest
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON.   15
intellects  : — that,  variously  modified,  has  proved  of  incalculable
service  in  aiding  to  develope  the  most  abstruse  and  the  highest
'ruths  in  Mathematics  and  Astronomy  :  and  that  was  of  itself
enough  to  render  any  name  illustrious  in  the  crowded  Annals  of
Science.
At  this  period,  the  most  distinguished  philosophers  were  direct
ing  all  their  energies  to  the  subject  of  light  and  the  improvement
of  the  refracting  telescope.  Newton,  having  applied  himself  to
the  grinding  of  "optic  glasses  of  other  figures  than  spherical,"  ex
perienced  the  impracticability  of  executing  such  lenses  ;  and  con
jectured  that  their  defects,  and  consequently  those  of  refracting
telescopes,  might  arise  from  some  other  cause  than  the  imperfect
convergency  of  rays  to  a  single  point.  He  accordingly  "procured
a  triangular  glass  prism  to  try  therewith  the  celebrated  phenom
ena  of  colours."  His  experiments,  entered  upon  with  zeal,  and
conducted  with  that  industry,  accuracy,  and  patient  thought,  for
which  he  was  so  remarkable,  resulted  in  the  grand  conclusion,
that  LIGHT  WAS  NOT  HOMOGENEOUS,  BUT  CONSISTED  OF  RAYS,
SOME  OF  WHICH  WERE  MORE    REFRANGIBLE    THAN    OTHERS.       This
profound  and  beautiful  discovery  opened  up  a  new  era  in  the
History  of  Optics.  As  bearing,  however,  directly  upon  the  construc
tion  of  telescopes,  he  saw  that  a  lens  refracting  exactly  like  a  prism
would  necessarily  bring  the  different  rays  to  different  foci,  at
different  distances  from  the  glass,  confusing  and  rendering  the
vision  indistinct.  Taking  for  granted  that  all  bodies  produced
spectra  of  ^  jtial  length,  he  dismissed  all  further  consideration  of
the  refracting  instrument,  and  took  up  the  principle  of  reflection.
Rays  of  all  colours,  he  found,  were  reflected  regularly,  so  that  the
angle  of  reflection  was  equal  to  the  angle  of  incidence,  and  hence
he  concluded  that  ojitical  instruments  might  be  brought  to  any
degree  of  perfection  imaginable,  provided  reflecting  specula  of
the  requisite  figure  and  finish  could  be  obtained.  At  this  stage
of  his  optical  researches,  he  was  forced  to  leave  Cambridge  on

He  retired  to  Woolsthorpe.  The  old  manor-house,  in  which  he
was  born,  was  situated  in  a  beautiful  little  valley,  on  the  west  side
of  the  river  Witham  ;  and  here  in  the  quiet  home  of  his  boyhood,

he  passed  his  days  in  serene  contemplation,  while  the  stalking
pestilence  was  hurrying  its  tens  of  thousands  into  undistinguisha  •
ble  graves.
Towards  the  close  of  a  pleasant  day  in  the  early  autumn  of
1666,  he  was  seated  alone  beneath  a  tree,  in  his  garden,  absorbed
in  meditation.  He  was  a  slight  young  man  ;  in  the  twenty-fourth
year  of  his  age  ;  his  countenance  mild  and  full  of  thought.  For
a  century  previous,  the  science  of  Astronomy  had  advanced  with
rapid  strides.  The  human  mind  had  risen  from  the  gloom  and
bondage  of  the  middle  ages,  in  unparalleled  vigour,  to  unfold  the
system,  to  investigate  the  phenomena,  and  to  establish  the  laws
of  the  heavenly  bodies.  Copernicus,  Tycho  Brahe,  Kepler,
Galileo,  and  others  had  prepared  and  lighted  the  way  for  him
who  was  ta  give  to  their  labour  its  just  value,  and  to  their  genius
its  true  lustre.  At  his  bidding  isolated  facts  were  to  take  order
as  parts  of  one  harmonious  whole,  and  sagacious  conjectures  grow
luminous  in  the  certain  splendour  of  demonstrated  truth.  And
this  ablest  man  had  come — was  here.  His  mind,  familiar  with
the  knowledge  of  past  effort,  and  its  unequalled  faculties  develop
ed  in  transcendant  strength,  was  now  moving  on  to  the  very
threshold  of  Its  grandest  achievement.  Step  by  step  the  untrod
den  path  was  measured,  till,  at  length,  the  entrance  seemed  dis
closed,  and  the  tireless  explorer  to  stand  amid  the  first  opening
wonders  of  the  universe.
The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes
all  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth — had,  in
deed,  dawned  upon  him.  And  reason  busily  united  link  to  link
of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the
vastest,  the  most  remote  to  the  nearest,  in  one  harmonious  bond.
From  the  bottoms  of  the  deepest  caverns  to  the  summits  of  the
highest  mountains,  this  power  suffers  no  sensible  change  :  may  not
its  action,  then,  extend  to  the  moon  ?  Undoubtedly  :  and  furthei
reflection  convinced  him  that  such  a  power  might  be  .sufficient  for
retaining  that  luminary  in  her  orbit  round  the  earth.  But,  though
this  power  suffers  no  sensible  variation,  in  the  little  change  of
distance  from  the  earth's  centre,  at  which  we  may  place  our-

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity,
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth,
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators.
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the
reach  of  observation —  analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  abandoned  awhile
further  inquiry,  and  remained  totally  silent  upon  the  subject.
These  rapid  marches  in  the  career  of  discovery,  combined  with
the  youth  of  Newton,  seem  to  evince  a  penetration  the  most
lively,  and

which  the  all-wise  God  perceives  and  understands  all  things.  He  is  ut
terly  void  of  all  body  and  bodily  figure,  and  can  therefore  neither  l^e  seen,
nor  heard,  nor  touched  ;  nor  ought  he  to  be  worshipped  under  the  repre
sentation  of  any  corporeal  thing.  We  have  ideas  of  his  attributes,  but
what  the  real  substance  of  any  thing  is  we  know  not.  In  bodies,  we  see
only  their  figures  and  colours,  we  hear  only  the  sounds,  we  touch  only  their
outward  surfaces,  we  smell  only  the  smells,  and  taste  the  savours  ;  but  their
inward  substances  are  not  to  be  known  either  by  our  senses,  or  by  any
reflex  act  of  our  minds  :  much  less,  then,  have  we  any  idea  of  the  sub
stance  of  God.  We  know  him  only  by  his  most  wise  and  excellent  con
trivances  of  things,  and  final  causes  ;  we  admire  him  for  his  perfections  ;
but  we  reverence  and  adore  him  on  account  of  his  dominion  :  for  we  adore
him  as  his  servants  ;  and  a  god  without  dominion,  providence,  and  final
causes,  is  nothing  else  but  Fate  and  Nature.  Blind  metaphysical  neces
sity,  which  is  certainly  the  same  always  and  every  where,  could  produce
no  variety  of  things.  All  that  diversity  of  natural  things  which  we  find
suited  to  different  times  and  places  could  arise  from  nothing  but  the  ideas
and  will  of  a  Being  necessarily  existing.  But,  by  way  of  allegory,  God
is  said  to  see,  to  speak,  to  laugh,  to  love,  to  hate,  to  desire,  to  give,  to  re
ceive,  to  rejoice,  to  be  angry,  to  fight,  to  frame,  to  work,  to  build  ;  for  all
our  notions  of  God  are  taken  from  the  ways  of  mankind  by  a  certain
similitude,  which,  though  not  perfect,  has  some  likeness,  however.  And
thus  much  concerning  God  ;  to  discourse  of  whom  from  the  appearances
of  things,  does  certainly  belong  to  Natural  Philosophy.
Hitherto  we  have  explained  the  phenomena  of  the  heavens  and  of  our
sea  by  the  power  of  gravity,  but  have  not  yet  assigned  the  cause  of  this
power.  This  is  certain,  that  it  must  proceed  from  a  cause  that  penetrates
'to  the  very  centres  of  the  sun  and  planets,  without  suffering  the  least
diminution  of  its  force;  that  operates  not  according  to  the  quantity  of
the  surfaces  of  the  particles  upon  which  it  acts  (as  mechanical  causes  use
to  do),  but  according  to  the  quantity  of  the  solid  matter  which  they  con
tain,,  and  propagates  its  virtue  on  all  sides  to  immense  distances,  decreasing
always  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distances.  Gravitation  towards
the  sun  is  made  up  out  of  the  gravitations  towards  the  several  particles
of  which  the  body  of  the  sun  is  composed  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  sun
decreases  accurately  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distances  MS  far  as
the  orb  of  Saturn,  as  evidently  appears  from  the  quiescence  of  the  aphe
lions  of  the  planets  ;  nay,  and  even  to  the  remotest  aphelions  of  the  comets,
if  those  aphelions  are  also  quiescent.  But  hitherto  I  have  not  been  able
to  discover  the  cause  of  those  properties  of  gravity  from  phenomena,  and
I  frame  no  hypotheses  ;  for  whatever  is  not  deduced  from  the  phenomena
is  to  be  called  an  hypothesis  ;  and  hypotheses,  whether  metaphysical  01
physical,  whether  of  occult  qualities  or  mechanical,  have  no  place  in  ex

perimental  philosophy.  In  this  philosophy  particular  propositions  are
inferred  from  the  phenomena,  and  afterwards  rendered  general  by  induc
tion.  Thus  it  was  that  the  impenetrability,  the  mobility,  and  the  impul
sive  force  of  bodies,  and  the  laws  of  motion  and  of  gravitation,  were
discovered.  And  to  us  it  is  enough  that  gravity  does  really  exist,  and  act
according  to  the  laws  which  we  have  explained,  and  abundantly  serves  to
account  for  all  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies,  and  of  our  sea.
And  now  we  might  add  something  concerning  a  certain  most  subtle
Spirit  which  pervades  and  lies  hid  in  all  gross  bodies  ;  by  the  force  and
action  of  which  Spirit  the  particles  of  bodies  mutually  attract  one  another
at  near  distances,  and  cohere,  if  contiguous  ;  and  electric  bodies  operate  to
greater  distances,  as  well  repelling  as  attracting  the  neighbouring  corpus
cles  ;  and  light  is  emitted,  reflected,  refracted,  inflected,  and  heats  bodies  ;
and  all  sensation  is  excited,  and  the  members  of  animal  bodies  move  at  the
command  of  the  will,  namely,  by  the  vibrations  of  this  Spirit,  mutually
propagated  along  the  solid  filaments  of  the  nerves,  from  the  outward  or
gans  of  sense  to  the  brain,  and  from  the  brain  into  the  muscles.  But  these
are  things  that  cannot  be  explained  in  few  words,  nor  are  we  furnished
with  that  sufficiency  of  experiments  which  is  required  to  an  accurate  deter
mination  and  demonstration  of  the  laws  by  which  this  electric  and  elastic
Spirit  operates.

THE  SYSTEM  OF  THE  WORLD,
THF
SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD
It.  was  the  ancient  opinion  of  not  a  few,  in  the  earliest  ages  of  philoso
phy,  that  the  fixed  stars  stood  immoveable  in  the  highest  parts  of  the  world  ;
that,  under  the  fixed  stars  the  planets  were  carried  about  the  sun  ;  that  the
earth,  us  one  of  the  planets,  described  an  annual  course  about  the  sun,  while
by  a  diurnal  motion  it  was  in  the  mean  time  revolved  about  its  own  axis;
and  that  the  sun,  as  the  common  fire  which  served  to  warm  the  whole,  was
fixed  in  the  centre  of  the  universe.
This  was  the  philosophy  taught  of  old  by  Philolans,  Aristarchus  of
Santos,  Plato  in  his  riper  years,  and  the  whole  sect  of  the  Pythagoreans  ;
and  this  was  the  judgment  of  Anaximander,  more  ancient  than  any  of
them  ;  and  of  that  wise  Iring  of  the  Rovnans,  Numa  Pompilins,  who,  as
a  symbol  of  the  figure  of  the  world  with  the  sun  in  the  centre,  erected  a
temple  in  honour  of  Vesta,  of  .%  i^und  form,  and  ordained  perpetual  fire  to
be  kept  in  the  middle  of  it.
The  Egyptians  were  early  observers  of  the  heavens  ;  and  from  them.,
probably,  this  philosophy  was  spread  abroad  among  other  nations  ;  for  from
them  it  was,  and  the  nations  about  them,  that  the  Greeks,  a  people  of
themselves  more  addicted  to  the  study  of  philology  than  of  nature,  derived
their  first,  as  well  as  soundest,  notions  of  philosophy  ;  and  in  the  vestal
ceremonies  we  may  yet  trace  the  ancient  spirit  of  the  Egyptians  ;  for  it
was  their  way  to  deliver  their  mysteries,  that  is,  their  philosophy  of  things
above  the  vulgar  way  of  thinking,  under  the  veil  of  religious  rites  and
hieroglyphic  symbols.
It  is  not  to  be  denied  but  that  Anaxa&oras,  Democritus,  and  others,
did  now  and  then  start  up,  who  would  have  it  that  the  earth  possessed  the
centre  of  the  world,  and  that  the  stars  of  all  sorts  were  revolved  towards
the  west  about  the  earth  quiescent  in  tk^  centre,  some  at  a  swifter,  others
at  a  slower  rate.
However,  it  was  agreed  on  both  sides  that  the  motions  of  the  celestial
bodies  were  performed  in  spaces  altogether  free  and  void  of  resistance.  The
whim  of  solid  orbs  was  of  a  later  date,  introduced  by  Eudoxus,  Calippus,
and  Aristotle;  when  the  ancient  philosophy  began  to  decline,  and  to  give
nlace  to  the  new  prevailing  fictions  of  the  Greeks.
But.  above  all  things,  the  phenomena  of  comets  can  by  no  means  consist
612   THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD.
with  the  notion  of  solid  orbs.  The  Chaldeans,  the  most  learned  astrono
mers  of  their  time,  looked  upon  the  comets  (which  of  ancient  times  before
had  been  numbered  among  the  celestial  bodies)  as  a  particular  sort  of  plan
ets,  which,  describing  very  eccentric  orbits,  presented  themselves  to  our  view
only  by  turns,  viz.,  once  in  a  revolution,  when  they  descended  into  the
lower  parts  of  their  orbits.
And  as  it  was  the  unavoidable  consequence  of  the  hypothesis  of  solid
orbs,  while  it  prevailed,  that  the  comets  should  be  thrust  down  below  the
moon,  so  no  sooner  had  the  late  observations  of  astronomers  restored  the
comets  to  their  ancient  places  in  the  higher  heavens,  but  these  celestial  spaces
were  at  once  cleared  of  the  incurnbrance  of  solid  orbs,  which  by  these  ob
servations  were  broke  into  pieces,  and  discarded  for  ever.
Whence  it  was  that  the  planets  came  to  be  retained  within  any  certain
bounds  in  these  free  spaces,  and  to  be  drawn  off  from  the  rectilinear  courses,
which,  left  to  themselves,  they  should  have  pursued,  into  regular  revolu
tions  in  curvilinear  orbits,  are  questions  which  we  do  not  know  how  the
ancients  explained  ;  and  probably  it  was  to  give  some  sort  of  satisfaction
to  this  difficulty  that  solid  orbs  were  introduced.
The  later  philosophers  pretend  to  account  for  it  either  by  the  action  of
certain  vortices,  as  Kepler  and  Des  Cartes  ;  or  by  some  other  principle  of
impulse  or  attraction,  as  Borelli,  Honke,  and  others  of  our  nation  ;  for,
from  the  laws  of  motion,  it  is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other.
But  our  purpose  is  only  to  trace  out  the  quantity  and  properties  of  this
force  from  the  phenomena  (p.  218),  and  to  apply  what  we  discover  in  some
simple  cases  as  principles,  by  which,  in  a  mathematical  way,  we  may  esti
mate  the  effects  thereof  in  more  involved  cases  :  for  it  would  be  endless  and
impossible  to  bring  every  particular  to  direct  and  immediate  observation.
We  said,  in  a  mathematical  way,  to  avoid  all  questions  about  the  na
ture  or  quality  of  this  force,  which  we  would  not  be  understood  to  deter
mine  by  any  hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it  by  the  general  name  of  a
centripetal  force,  as  it  is  a  force  which  is  directed  towards  some  centre ;
and  as  it  regards  more  particularly  a  body  in  that  centre,  we  call  it  circum
solar,  circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial  ;  and  in  like  manner  in  respect  of
other  central  bodies.
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD.   513
creased,  that  it  would  describe  an  arc  of  1,  2,  5,  10,  100.  1000  miles  before
it  arrived  at  the  earth,  till  at  last,  exceeding  the  limits  of  the  earth,  it
should  pass  quite  by  without  touching  it.
Let  AFB  represent  the  surface  of  the  earth,  C  its  centre,  VD,  VE,  VF,
the  curve  lines  which  a  body  would  describe,  if  projected  in  an  horizontal
direction  from  the  top  of  an  high  mountain  successively  "with  more  and
more  velocity  (p.  400) ;  and,  because  the  celestial  motions  are  scarcely  re
tarded  by  the  little  or  no  resistance  of  the  spaces  in  which  they  are  per
formed,  to  keep  up  the  parity  of  cases,  let  us  suppose  either  that  there  is
no  air  about  the  earth,  or  at  least  that  it  is  endowed  with  little  or  no  power
of  resisting ;  and  for  the  same  reason  tl  a*:  the  body  projected  with  a  less
velocity  describes  the  lesser  arc  VD,  and  with  a  greater  velocity  the  greater
arc  VE.  and,  augmenting  the  velocity,  it  goes  farther  and  farther  to  F  and
G,  if  the  velocity  was  still  more  and  more  augmented,  it  would  reach  at
last  quite  beyond  the  circumference  of  the  earth,  and  return  to  the  moun
tain  from  which  it  was  projected.
And  since  the  areas  which  by  this  motion  it  describes  by  a  radius  drawn
to  the  centre  of  the  earth  are  (by  Prop.  1,  Book  1,  Princip.  Math.}  propor
tional  to  the  times  in  which  they  are  described,  its  velocity,  when  it  returns
*o  the  mountain,  will  be  no  less  than  it  was  at  first;  and,  retaining  the
*ame  velocity,  it  will  describe  the  same  curve  over  and  over,  by  the  same  law
514   THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD.
But  if  we  now  imagine  bodies  to  be  projected  in  the  directions  of  lines
parallel  to  the  horizon  from  greater  heights,  as  of  5,  10,  100,  1000,  or  more
miles,  or  rather  as  many  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  those  bodies,  accord
ing  to  their  different  velocity,  and  the  different  force  of  gravity  in  different
heights,  will  describe  arcs  either  concentric  with  the  earth,  or  variously
eccentric,  and  go  on  revolving  through  the  heavens  in  those  trajectories,
just  as  the  planets  do  in  their  orbs.
As  when  a  stone  is  projected  obliquely,  that  is,  any  way  but  in  the  per
pendicular  direction,  the  perpetual  deflection  thereof  towards  the  earth
from  the  right  line  in  which  it  was  projected  is  a  proof  of  its  gravitation
to  the  earth,  no  less  certain  than  its  direct  descent  when  only  suffered  to
fall  freely  from  rest  ;  so  the  deviation  of  bodies  moving  in  free  spaces  from
rectilinear  paths,  and  perpetual  deflection  therefrom  towards  any  place,  is
a  sure  indication  of  the  existence  of  some  force  which  from  all  quarters
impels  those  bodies  towards  that  place.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
either  descend  directly  to  the  earth,  if  they  are  let  fall  from  rest,  or  at
least  perpetually  deviate  from  right  lines  towards  the  earth,  if  they  arc
projected  obliquely  ;  so  from  the  supposed  existence  of  a  force  directed  to
any  centre,  it  will  follow,  by  the  like  necessity,  that  all  bodies  upon  which
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines.
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy.
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles,
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator,
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description.
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1),
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs,
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the
planets.
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis  ;  for
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD.   515
this  is  an  indi  ation  of  an  increase  to  immensity,  or  rather  to  infinity  ;
whereas  the  forces  of  natural  things  commonly  decrease  in  receding  from
the  fountain  from  which  they  flow.  But,  what  is  yet  more  absurd,  neither
are  the  areas  described  by  the  same  star  proportional  to  the  times,  nor  are
its  revolutions  performed  in  the  same  orb  ;  for  as  the  star  recedes  from  the
neighbouring  pole,  both  areas  and  orb  increase;  and  from  the  increase  of
the  urea  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  forces  are  not  directed  to  the  axis  of
the  earth.  And  this  difficulty  (Cor.  1,  Prop.  II)  arises  from  the  twofold
motion  that  is  observed  in  the  fixed  stars,  one  diurnal  round  the  axis  of
the  earth,  the  other  exceedingly  slow  round  the  axis  of  the  ecliptic.  And
the  explication  thereof  requires  a  composition  of  forces  so  perplexed  and
so  variable,  that  it  is  hardly  to  be  reconciled  with  any  physical  theory.
That  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  to  the  bodies  of  the
sun,  of  the  earth,  and  other  planets,  I  thus  infer.
The  moon  revolves  about  our  earth,  and  by  radii  drawn  to  its  centre
(p.  390)  describes  areas  nearly  proportional  to  the  times  in  which  they  are
described,  as  is  evident  from  its  velocity  compared  with  its  apparent  diame
ter  ;  for  its  motion  is  slower  when  its  diameter  is  less  (and  therefore  its
distance  greater),  and  its  motion  is  swifter  when  its  diameter  is  greater.
The  revolutions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  about  that  planet  are  more
regular  (p.  386)  :  for  they  describe  circles  concentric  with  Jupiter  by  equa
ble  motions,  as  exactly  as  our  senses  can  distinguish.
And  so  the  satellites  of  Saturn  are  revolved  about  this  planet  with  mo
tions  nearly  (p.  387)  circular  and  equable,  scarcely  disturbed  by  any  eccen
tricity  hitherto  observed.
That  Venus  and  Mercury  are  revolved  about  the  sun,  is  demonstrable
from  their  moon-like  appearances  (p.  388) .  when  they  shine  with  a  full
face,  they  are  in  those  parts  of  their  orbs  which  in  respect  of  the  earth  lie
beyond  the  sun  ;  when  they  appear  half  full,  they  are  in  those  parts  whicli
Ire  over  against  the  sun  ;  when  horned,  in  those  parts  which  lie  between
the  earth  and  the  sun  ;  and  sometimes  they  pass  over  the  sun's  disk,  when
directly  interposed  between  the  eirth  and  the  sun.
And  Venus,  with  a  motion  almost  uniform,  describes  an  orb  nearly  cir
cular  and  concentric  with  the  sun.
But  Mercury,  with  a  more  eccentric  motion,  makes  remarkable  ap
proaches  to  the  sun,  and  goes  off  again  by  turns  ;  but  it  is  always  swifter
as  it  is  near  to  the  sun,  and  therefore  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun  still
describes  areas  proportional  to  the  times.
Lastly,  that  the  earth  describes  about  the  sun,  or  the  sun  about  the
earth,  by  a  radius  from  the  one  to  the  other,  areas  exactly  proportional  to
the  times,  is  demonstrable  from  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  sun  com
pared  with  its  apparent  motion.
These  are  astronomical  experiments  ;  from  which  it  follows,  by  Prop.  I,
516  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD.
11,  III,  in  the  first  Book  of  our  Pn /triples,  and  their  Corollaries  (p.
213,  214).  that  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  (either  accu
rately  or  without  considerable  error)  to  the  centres  of  the  earth,  of  Jupi
ter,  of  S.iturn,  and  of  the  sun.  In  Mercury,  Venus,  Mars,  and  the  lesser
planets,  wheie  experiments  are  wanting,  the  arguments  from  analogy  must
be  allowed  in  their  place.
That  those  forces  (p.  212,  213,  214)  decrease  in  the  duplicate  propor
tion  of  the  distances  from  the  centre  of  every  planet,  appears  by  Cor.  VI,
Prop.  IV,  Book  1  ;  for  the  periodic  times  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  are
one  to  another  (p.  386,  387)  in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  dis
tances  from  the  centre  of  this  planet.
This  proportion  has  been  long  ago  observed  in  those  satellites  ;  and  Mr.
Flamsted,  who  had  often  measured  their  distances  from  Jupiter  by  the
micrometer,  and  by  the  eclipses  of  the  satellites,  wrote  to  me,  that  it  holds
to  all  the  accuracy  that  possibly  can  be  discerned  by  our  senses.  And  he
sent  me  the  dimensions  of  their  orbits  taken  by  the  micrometer,  a*nd  re
duced  to  the  mean  distance  of  Jupiter  from  the  earth,  or  from  the  sun,
together  with  the  times  of  their  revolutions,  as  follows  : —

And  the  periodic  times  of  those  satellites,  by  the  observations  of  Mr.
Flamsted,  are  ld.  18h.  28'  36"  |  3(l.  13".  17'  54"  |  7(1.  3h.  59'  36"  |  16".
IS11.  5'  13".  as  above.
And  the  distances  thence  computed  are  5,578  |  8,878  |  14,168  |  24,968,
accurately  agreeing  with  the  distances  by  observation.
Cassini  assures  us  (p.  388,  389)  that  the  same  proportion  is  observed
in  the  circum-saturnal  planets.  But  a  longer  course  of  observations  is
required  before  we  can  have  a  certain  and  accurate  theory  of  those  planets.
In  the  circum -solar  planets,  Mercury  and  Venus,  the  same  proportion
holds  with  great  accuracy,  according  to  the  dimensions  of  their  orbs,  as
determined  by  the  observations  of  the  best  astronomers.
That  Mars  is  revolved  about  the  sun  is  demonstrated  from  the  phases
which  it  shews,  and  the  proportion  of  its  apparent  diameters  (p.  388,  389,
and  390) ;  for  from  its  appearing  fall  near  conjunction  with  the  sun,  and
gibbous  in  its  quadratures,  it  is  certain  that  it  surrounds  the  sun.
And  since  its  diameter  appears  about  five  times  greater  when  in  opposi
tion  to  the  sun  than  when  in  conjunction  therewith,  and  its  distance  from
the  earth  is  reciprocally  as  its  apparent  diameter,  that  distance  will  be
about  five  times  less  when  in  opposition  to  than  when  in  conjunction  with
the  sun;  but  in  both  cases  its  distance  from  the  sun  will  be  nearly  about
the  same  with  the  distance  which  is  inferred  from  its  gibbous  appearance
in  the  quadratures.  And  as  it  encompasses  the  sun  at  almost  equal  dist  n-
ces,  but  in  respect  of  the  earth  is  very  unequally  distant,  so  by  radii  drawn
to  the  sun  it  describes  areas  nearly  uniform  ;  but  by  radii  drawn  to  the
earth,  it  is  sometimes  swift,  sometimes  stationary,  and  sometimes  retrograde.
That  Jupiter,  in  a  higher  orb  than  Mars,  is  likewise  revolved  about  the
sun,  with  a  motion  nearly  equable,  as  well  in  distance  as  in  the  areas  des
cribed,  1  infer  thus.
Mr.  Flamsted  assured  me,  by  letters,  that  all  the  eclipses  of  the  inner
most  satellite  which  hitherto  have  been  well  observed  do  agree  with  his
theory  so  nearly,  as  never  to  differ  therefrom  by  two  minutes  of  time  ;
that  in  the  outmost  the  error  is  little  greater  ;  in  the  outmost  but  one,
scarcely  three  times  greater ;  that  in  the  innermost  but  one  the  difference
is  indeed  much  greater,  yet  so  as  to  agree  as  nearly  with  his  computation?
as  the  moon  does  with  the  common  tables  ;  and  that  he  computes  those
eclipses  only  from  the  mean  motions  corrected  by  the  equation  of  light  dis
covered  and  introduced  by  Mr.  Rower.  Supposing,  then,  that  the  theory
differs  by  a  less  error  than  that  of  2'  from  the  motion  of  the  outmost  sat
ellite  as  hitherto  described,  and  taking  as  the  periodic  time  16'1.  18h.  5'  13"
to  2  in  time,  so  is  the  whole  circle  or  360°  to  the  arc  1'  48",  the  error  ol
Mr.  Flamsted's  computation,  reduced  to  the  satellite's  orbit,  will  be  less
than  1'  48"  ;  that  is,  the  longitude  of  the  satellite,  as  seen  from  tlie  centre
of  Jupiter;  will  be  determined  with  a  less  error  than  1'  48".  But  when
518   THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD.
the  satellite  is  in  the  middle  of  the  shadow,  that  longitude  is  the  same  with
the  heliocentric  longitude  of  Jupiter ;  and,  therefore,  the  hypothesis  which
Mr.  Flamsted  follows,  viz.,  the  Copernican,  as  improved  by  Kepler,  and
fas  to  the  motion  of  Jupiter)  lately  corrected  by  himself,  rightly  represents
that  longitude  within  a  less  error  than  1'  48" ;  but  by  this  longitude,  to
gether  with  the  geocentric  longitude,  which  is  always  easily  found,  the  dis
tance  of  Jupiter  from  the  sun  is  determined  ;  which  must,  therefore,  be  the
very  same  with  that  which  the  hypothesis  exhibits.  For  that  greatest  error
of  I'  48"  that  can  happen  in  the  heliocentric  longitude  is  almost  insensi
ble,  and  quite  to  be  neglected,  and  perhaps  may  arise  from  some  yet  undis
covered  eccentricity  of  the  satellite  :  but  since  both  longitude  and  distance
are  rightly  determined,  it  follows  of  necessity  that  Jupiter,  by  radii  drawn
to  the  sun.  describes  areas  so  conditioned  as  the  hypothesis  requires,  that  is.
proportional  to  the  times.
And  the  same  thing  may  be  concluded  of  Saturn  from  his  satellite,  by
the  observations  of  Mr.  Huygens  and  Dr.  Halley  ;  though  a  longer  series
of  observations  is  yet  wanting  to  confirm  the  thing,  and  to  bring  it  under
a  sufficiently  exact  computation.
For  if  Jupiter  was  viewed  from  the  sun,  it  would  never  appear  retro
grade  nor  stationary,  as  it  is  seen  sometimes  from  the  earth,  but  always  to
go  forward  with  a  motion  nearly  uniform  (p.  389).  And  from  the  very
great  inequality  of  its  apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop.  Ill
Cor.  IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course,
and  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth.
And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn.  Another  centre
of  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop.  II  and  III,  and  the
Corollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter
vening  may  be  equable  ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already
in  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter.  It  may  be
alledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally
and  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.  VI  of
the  Laws  of  Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the
planets  one  to  another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect  follow  :  but  our  business  is
with  the  causes  of  sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such
force  as  imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in  the  phenomena  of  the
heavens  ;  and  the  whole  remaining  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  impelled  will
be  directed  (by  Prop.  Ill,  Cor.  I)  to  the  centre  of  the  sun.
The  distances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  come  out  the  same,  whether,
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  system,  or  the  sun  with
Copernicus  :  and  we  have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir.
Jupiter.
Kepler  and  Bullialdiis  have,  with  great  care  (p.  388),  determined  the
listances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  ;  and  hence  it  is  that  their  table.-?
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD.   519
agree  best  with  the  heavens.  And  in  all  the  planets,  in  Jupiter  and  Mars,
in  Saturn  and  the  earth,  as  well  as  in  Venus  and  Mercury,  the  cubes  of  their
distances  are  as  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times ;  and  therefore  (by  Cor.
VI,  Prop.  IV)  the  centripetal  circum-solar  force  throughout  all  the  plane
tary  regions  decreases  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distances  from  the
sun.  In  examining  this  proportion,  we  are  to  use  the  mean  distances,  or
the  transverse  semi-axes  of  the  orbits  (by  Prop.  XV).  arid  to  neglect  those
little  fractions,  which,  in  denning  the  orbits,  may  have  arisen  from  the  in
sensible  errors  of  observation,  or  may  be  ascribed  to  other  causes  which  we
shall  afterwards  explain.  And  thus  we  shall  always  find  the  said  propor
tion  to  hold  exactly;  for  the  distances  of  Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  the  Earth,
Venus,  and  Mercury,  from  the  sun,  drawn  from  the  observations  of  as
tronomers,  are,  according  to  the  computation  of  Kepler,  as  the  numbers
95  LOGO,  519650,  152350,  100000,  72400,  3S806;  by  the  computation  of
/iHllialdus,  as  the  numbers  95419S,  522520,  152350,  100000,  72393,
38585  ;  and  from  the  periodic  times  they  come  out  953806,  520116,  152399,
100000,  72333,  38710.  Their  distances,  according  to  Kepler  and
Ktillwldus,  scarcely  differ  by  any  sensible  quantity,  and  where  they
differ  most  the  distances  drawn  from  the  periodic  times,  fall  in  between  them.
That  the  circum-terrestrial  force  likewise  decreases  in  the  duplicate  pro
portion  of  the  distances,  I  infer  thus.
The  mean  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  is,  in  semi-
diameters  of  the  earth,  according  to  Ptolemy,  Kepler  in  his  Ephemerides,
Bidliuldus,  Hevelius,  and  Ricciolns,  59 ;  according  to  Flamsted,  59|  ;
according  to  Tycho,  56 1 ;  to  Vendelin,  60  ;  to  Copernicus,  60 1 :  to  Kir-
cher,  62i  (p.  391,  392,  393).
Cut  Tycho,  and  all  that  follow  his  tables  of  refraction,  making  the
refractions  of  the  sun  and  moon  (altogether  against  the  nature  of  light)
to  exceed  those  of  the  fixed  stars,  and  that  by  about  four  or  five  minutes
in  the  horizon,  did  thereby  augment  the  horizontal  parallax  of  the  moon
by  about  the  like  number  of  minutes  ;  that  is,  by  about  the  12th  or  15th

 right  line,  and  that  with  an  uniform  motion,, if  the  re
sistance  of  the  air  was  taken  away.  It  is  by  its  gravity  that  it  is  drawn
aside  perpetually  from  its  rectilinear  course,  and  made  to  deviate  towards
the  earth,  more  or  less,  according  to  the  force  of  its  gravity,  and  the  velo
city  of  its  motion.  The  less  its  gravity  is,  for  the  quantity  of  its  matter,
or  the  greater  the  velocity  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  less  will  it  devi
ate  from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  the  farther  it  will  go.  If  a  leaden  balJ,
projected  from  the  top  of  a  mountain  by  the  force  of  gunpowder  with  a
given  velocity,  and  in  a  direction  parallel  to  the  horizon,  is  carried  in  a
curve  line  to  the  distance  of  two  miles  before  it  falls  to  the  ground  ;  the
same,  if  the  resistance  of  the  air  were  taken  away,  with  a  double  or  decuple
velocity,  would  fly  twice  or  ten  times  as  far.  And  by  increasing  the  velo
city,  we  may  at  pleasure  increase  the  distance  to  which  it  might  be  pro
jected,  and  diminish  the  curvature  of  the  line,  which  it  might  describe,  till
at  last  it  should  fall  at  the  distance  of  10,  30,  or  90  degrees,  or  even  might
go  quite  round  the  whole  earth  before  it  falls ;  or  lastly,  so  that  it  might
never  fall  to  the  earth,  but  go  forward  into  the  celestial  spaces,  and  pro
ceed  in  its  motion  in  iiifiuitum.  And  after  the  same  manner  that  a  pro
jectile,  by  the  force  of  gravity,  may  be  made  to  revolve  in  an  orbit,  and  go
round  the  whole  earth,  the  moon  also,  either  by  the  force  of  gravity,  if  it
is  endued  with  gravity,  or  by  any  other  force,  that  impels  it  towards  the
earth,  may  be  perpetually  drawn  aside  towards  the  earth,  out  of  the  r&ti-
linear  way,  which  by  its  innate  force  it  would  pursue;  and  would  be  made
to  revolve  in  the  orbit  which  it  now  describes  ;  nor  could  the  moon  with
out  some  such  force,  be  retained  in  its  orbit.  If  this  force  was  too  small,
it  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course  :  if  it
was  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from
its  orbit  towards  the  earth.  It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just
quantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may
serve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and
vice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected
from  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from
its  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force.
The  quantity  of  any  centripetal  force  may  be  considered  as  of  three
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive.
DEFINITION  VI.
The  absolute  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure  f>f  the  same
proportional  to  the  efficacy  of  the  cause  that  propagates  it  from  the  cen
tre,  through  the  spaces  round  about.
Thus  the  magnetic  force  is  greater  in  one  load-stone  and  less  in  another
according  to  their  sizes  and  strength  of  intensity.

DEFINITION  VII.
The  accelerative  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure,  of  tht
same,  proportional  to  the  velocity  which  it  generates  in  a  given  time.
Thus  the  force  of  the  same  load-stone  is  greater  at  a  less  distance,  and
less  at  a  greater :  also  the  force  of  gravity  is  greater  in  valleys,  less  on
tops  of  exceeding  high  mountains  ;  and  yet  less  (as  shall  hereafter  be  shown),
at  greater  distances  from  the  body  of  the  earth ;  but  at  equal  distan
ces,  it  is  the  same  everywhere  ;  because  (taking  away,  or  allowing  for,  the
resistance  of  the  air),  it  equally  accelerates  all  falling  bodies,  whether  heavy
or  light,  great  or  small.
DEFINITION  VIII.
TJie  motive  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force,  is  the  measure  of  the  samt\
proportional  to  the  motion  which  it  generates  in  a  given  twip.
Thus  the  weight  is  greater  in  a  greater  body,  less  in  a  less  body ;  and.
in  the  same  body,  it  is  greater  near  to  the  earth,  and  less  at  remoter  dis
tances.  This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al
ways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient
to  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body.
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre  ;  to  the  places
of  those  bodies  ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the
several  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the
body,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places
around  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them  :  and  the  absolute  force  to
the  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces
would  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about  ;  whether  that
cause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or
anything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.  For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical
causes  and  seats.
Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter  :  and  the  motive  force  arises
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   77
surface  of  the  earth,  where  the  accelerative  gravity,  or  force  productive  of
gravity,  in  all  bodies  is  the  same,  the  motive  gravity  or  the  weight  is  as
the  body :  but  if  we  should  ascend  to  higher  regions,  where  the  accelerative
gravity  is  less,  the  weight  would  be  equally  diminished,  and  would  always
be  as  the  product  of  the  body,  by  the  accelerative  gravity.  So  in  those  re
gions,  where  the  accelerative  gravity  is  diminished  into  one  half,  the  weight
of  a  body  two  or  three  times  less,  will  be  four  or  six  times  less.
I  likewise  call  attractions  and  impulses,  in  the  same  sense,  accelerative,
and  motive  ;  and  use  the  words  attraction,  impulse  or  propensity  of  any
sort  towards  a  centre,  promiscuously,  and  indifferently,  one  for  another  ;
considering  those  forces  not  physically,  but  mathematically  :  wherefore,  the
reader  is  not  to  imagine,  that  by  those  words,  I  anywhere  take  upon  me  to
define  the  kind,  or  the  manner  of  any  action,  the  causes  or  the  physical
reason  thereof,  or  that  I  attribute  forces,  in  a  true  and  physical  sense,  to
certain  centres  (which  are  only  mathematical  points) ;  when  at  any  time  I
happen  to  speak  of  centres  as  attracting,  or  as  endued  with  attractive
powers.
SCHOLIUM.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
I.  Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na
ture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another
name  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen
sible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by
the  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such
as  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year.
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces  ;  which  our  senses  de
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies  ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude  ;  but  they  do  not  re
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves,
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
TS   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
the  air  passes  ;  at  another  time  it  will  be  another  part  of  the  same,  and  so.
absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable.
III.  Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to
the  space,  either  absolute  or  relative.   I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation,
nor  the  external  surface  of  the  body.     For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are
always  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are
often  unequal.     Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much
the  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places.     The  motion  of  the  whole
is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the
translation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum
of  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place
of  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and
for  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body.
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute
place  into  another  ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses  ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship :
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
ship,  or  of  its  cavity.     But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself,
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is
really  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and
absolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth.
But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will
arise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly
from  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves
also  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true
motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo
tions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the
earth.     As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved
toward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with
a  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex
pressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the
east,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly
in  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   79
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow,
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are
only  sensible  measures  thereof  ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves.
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession  ;
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one
another  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of
them.  For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con
sidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions,
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af
fairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our
senses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible
measures  of  them.  For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to
which  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest,
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies
in  our  regions.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ;
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
8C   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
mined  by  the  translation  of  it  from  those  which  only  seem  to  rest ;  for  the
external  bodies  ought  not  only  to  appear  at  rest,  but  to  be  really  at  rest.
For  otherwise,  all  included  bodies,  beside  their  translation  from  near  the
surrounding  ones,  partake  likewise  of  their  true  motions  ;  and  though  that
translation  were  not  made  they  would  not  be  really  at  rest,  but  only  seem
to  be  so.  For  the  surrounding  bodies  stand  in  the  like  relation  to  the
surrounded  as  the  exterior  part  of  a  whole  does  to  the  interior,  or  as  the
shell  does  to  the  kernel  ;  but,  if  the  shell  moves,  the  kernel  will  also
move,  as  being  part  of  the  whole,  without  any  removal  from  near  the  shell.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved,
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body,
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions  ;  and  every  entire  motion
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another  ;  and  upon  this  account
must  ever  remain  unmoved  ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion.
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed
upon  the  body  moved  :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared,
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies,
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no
means  consist  in  such  relations.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the

motion.  If  a  vessel,  hung:  by  &  }ong  cord,  is  so  often  turned  ubout  that  the
cord  is  strongly  twisted,  then  filled  with  water,  and  held  at  rest  together
with  the  water  ;  after,  by  the  sudden  action  of  another  force,  it  is  whirled
about  the  contrary  way,  and  while  the  cord  is  untwisting  itself,  the  vessel
continues  for  some  time  in  this  motion  ;  the  surface  of  the  water  will  at
first  be  plain,  as  before  the  vessel  began  to  move  :  but  the  vessel;  by  grad
ually  communicating  its  motion  to  the  water,  will  make  it  begin  sensibly
^to  revolve,  and  recede  by  little  and  little  from  the  middle,  and  ascend  to  the
sides  of  the  vessel,  forming  itself  into  a  concave  figure  (as  I  have  experi
enced),  and  the  swifter  the  motion  becomes,  the  higher  will  the  water  rise,
till  at  last,  performing  its  revolutions  in  the  same  times  with  the  vessel,
it  becomes  relatively  at  rest  in  it.  This  ascent  of  the  water  shows  its  en
deavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  its  motion  ;  and  the  true  and  absolute
circular  motion  of  the  water,  which  is  here  directly  contrary  to  the  rela-
tivej  discovers  itself,  and  may  be  measured  by  this  endeavour.  At  first,
when  the  relative  motion  of  the  water  in  the  vessel  was  greatest,  it  pro
duced  no  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis ;  the  water  showed  no  tendency
to  the  circumference,  nor  any  ascent  towards  the  sides  of  the  vessel,  but
remained  of  a  plain  surface,  and  therefore  its  true  circular  motion  had  not
yet  begun.  But  afterwards,  when  the  relative  motion  of  the  water  had
decreased,  the  ascent  thereof  towards  the  sides  of  the  vessel  proved  its  en
deavour  to  recede  from  the  axis ;  and  this  endeavour  showed  the  real  cir
cular  motion  of  the  water  perpetually  increasing,  till  it  had  acquired  its
greatest  quantity,  wh en  the  water  rested  relatively  in  the  vessel.  And
therefore  this  endeavour  does  not  depend  upon  any  translation  of  the  water
in  respect  of  the  ambient  bodies,  nor  can  true  circular  motion  be  defined
by  such  translation.  There  is  only  one  real  circular  motion  of  any  one
revolving  body,  corresponding  to  only  one  power  of  endeavouring  to  recede
from  its  axis  of  motion,  as  its  proper  and  adequate  effect  ;  but  relative
motions,  in  one  and  the  same  body,  are  innumerable,  according  to  the  various
relations  it  bears  to  external  bodies,  and  like  other  relations,  arc  altogether
destitute  of  any  real  effect,  any  otherwise  than  they  may  perhaps  par
take  of  that  one  only  true  motion.  And  therefore  in  their  system  who
suppose  that  our  heavens,  revolving  below  the  sphere  of  the  fixed  stars,
carry  the  planets  along  with  them  ;  the  several  parts  of  those  heavens,  and
the  planets,  which  are  indeed  relatively  at  rest  in  their  heavens,  do  yet
really  move.  For  they  change  their  position  one  to  another  (which  never
happens  to  bodies  truly  at  rest),  and  being  carried  together  with  their
heavens,  partake  of  their  motions,  and  as  parts  of  revolving  wholes,
endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  their  motions.
Wherefore  relative  quantities  are  not  the  quantities  themselves,  whose
names  they  bear,  but  those  sensible  measures  of  them  (either  accurate  cr
inaccurate),  which  arc  commonly  used  instead  of  the  measured  quantities
themselves.  And  if  the  meaning  of  words  is  to  he  determined  bv  their
82   THE  MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
use,  then  by  the  names  time,  space,  place  and  motion,  their  measures  arv
properly  to  be  understood  ;  and  the  expression  will  be  unusual,  and  purely
mathematical,  if  the  measured  quantities  themselves  are  meant.  Upon
which  account,  they  do  strain  the  sacred  writings,  who  there  interpret
those  words  for  the  measured  quantities.  Nor  do  those  less  defile  the
purity  of  mathematical  and  philosophical  truths,  who  confound  real  quan
tities  themselves  with  their  relations  and  vulgar  measures.
It  is  indeed  a  matter  of  great  difficulty  to  discover,  and  effectually  to
distinguish,  the  true  motions  of  particular  bodies  from  the  apparent ;  be
cause  the  parts  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  those  motions  are  per
formed,  do  by  no  means  come  under  the  observation  of  our  senses.  Yet
the  thing  is  not  altogether  desperate :  for  we  have  some  arguments  to
guide  us,  partly  from  the  apparent  motions,  which  are  the  differences  of
the  true  motions  ;  partly  from  the  forces,  which  are  the  causes  and  effects
of  the  true  motions.  For  instance,  if  tAvo  globes,  kept  at  a  given  distance
one  from  the  other  by  means  of  a  cord  that  connects  them,  were  revolved
about  their  common  centre  of  gravity,  we  might,  from  the  tension  of  the
cord,  discover  the  endeavour  of  the  globes  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  their
motion,  and  from  thence  we  might  compute  the  quantity  of  their  circular
motions.  And  then  if  any  equal  forces  should  be  impressed  at  once  on  the
alternate  faces  of  the  globes  to  augment  or  diminish  their  circular  motions,
from  the  increase  or  decr»  ase  of  the  tensicn  of  1  le  cord,  we  might  infer
the  increment  or  decrement  of  their  motions  :  and  thence  would  be  found
on  what  faces  those  forces  ought  to  be  impressed,  that  the  motions  of  the
globes  might  be  most  augmented  ;  that  is,  we  might  discover  their  hinder-
most  faces,  or  those  which,  in  the  circular  motion,  do  follow.  But  the
faces  which  follow  being  known,  and  consequently  the  opposite  ones  that
precede,  we  should  likewise  know  the  determination  of  their  motions.  And
thus  we  might  find  both  the  quantity  and  the  determination  of  this  circu
lar  motion,  even  in  an  immense  vacuum,  where  there  was  nothing  external
or  sensible  with  which  the  globes  could  be  compared.  But  now,  if  in  that
space  some  remote  bodies  were  placed  that  kept  always  a  given  position
one  to  another,  as  the  fixed  stars  do  in  our  regions,  we  could  not  indeed
determine  from  the  relative  translation  of  the  globes  among  those  bodies,
whether  the  motion  did  belong  to  the  globes  or  to  the  bodies.  But  if  we
observed  the  cord,  and  found  that  its  tension  was  that  very  tension  which
the  motions  of  the  globes  required,  we  might  conclude  the  motion  to  be  in
the  globes,  and  the  bodies  to  be  at  rest  ;  and  then,  lastly,  from  the  trans
lation  of  the  globes  among  the  bodies,  we  should  find  the  determination  oi
their  motions.  But  how  we  are  to  collect  the  true  motions  from  their
causes,  effects,  and  apparent  differences  ;  and,  vice  versa,  how  from  the  mo
tions,  either  true  or  apparent,  we  may  come  to  the  knowledge  of  theii
causes  and  effects,  shall  be  explained  more  at  large  in  the  following  tra<;t
For  to  this  end  it  was  that  I  composed  it.
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.
AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION.
LAW  I.
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed
thereon.
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time.
LAW   II.
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force
is  impressed.
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both.
LAW  III.
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction  :  or  the  mu
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di
rected  to  contrary  parts.
Whatever  draws  or  presses  another  is  as  much  drawn  or  pressed  by  that
other.  If  you  press  a  stone  with  your  finger,  the  finger  is  also  pressed  by
the  stone.  If  a  horse  draws  a  stone  tied  to  a  rope,  the  horse  (if  I  may  so
say)  will  be  equally  drawn  back  towards  the  stone:  for  the  distended  rope,
by  the  same  endeavour  to  relax  or  unbend  itself,  will  draw  the  horse  as
much  towards  the  stone,  as  it  does  the  stone  towards  the  horse,  and  will
obstruct  the  progress  of  the  one  as  much  as  it  advances  that  of  the  other.
84   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
If  a  body  impinge  upon  another,  and  by  its  force  change  the  motion  of  (It*
other,  that  body  also  (because  of  the  equality  of  the  mutual  pressure)  will
undergo  an  equal  change,  in  its  own  motion,  towards  the  contrary  part.
The  changes  made  by  these  actions  are  equal,  not  in  the  velocities  but  in
the  motions  of  bodies ;  that  is  to  say,  if  the  bodies  are  not  hindered  by  any
other  impediments.  For,  because  the  motions  are  equally  changed,  the
changes  of  the  velocities  made  towards  contrary  parts  are  reciprocally  pro
portional  to  the  bodies.  This  law  takes  place  also  in  attractions,  as  will
be  proved  in  the  next  scholium.
COROLLARY  I.
A  body  by  two  forces  conjoined  will  describe  the  diagonal  of  a  parallelo
gram,  in  the  same  time  that  it  wovld  describe  the  sides,  by  those  forces
apart.
If  a  body  in  a  given  time,  by  the  force  M  impressed
apart  in  the  place  A,  should  with  an  uniform  motion        /
be  carried  from  A  to  B ;  and  by  the  force  N  impressed
apart  in  the  same  place,  should  be  carried  from  A  to  c  ~\)
C  ;  complete  the  parallelogram  ABCD,  and,  by  both  forces  acting  together,
it  will  in  the  same  time  be  carried  in  the  diagonal  from  A  to  D.     For
since  the  force  N  acts  in  the  direction  of  the  line  AC,  parallel  to  BD,  this
force  (by  the  second  law)  will  not  at  all  alter  the  velocity  generated  by  the
other  force  M,  by  which  the  body  is

he  squares  of  as  many  semi-
diameters  KN  ;  and  therefore  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  all  the  sines  NM
will  be  but  half  so  great  as  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  as  many  semi-diam
eters  KN.
Suppose  now  the  circumference  of  the  circle  AE  to  be  divided  into  the
like  number  of  little  equal  parts,  and  from  every  such  part  P  a  perpen
dicular  FG  to  be  let  fall  upon  the  plane  QK,  as  well  as  the  perpendicular
AH  from  the  point  A.  Then  the  force  by  which  the  particle  F  recede*
456   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES   [BOOK  IIL
from  the  plane  QR  will  (by  supposition)  be  as  that  perpendicular  FG  ;  and
this  force  multiplied  by  the  distance  CG  will  represent  the  power  of  the
particle  F  to  turn  the  earth  round  its  centre.  And,  therefore,  the  power
of  a  particle  in  the  place  F  will  be  to  the  power  of  a  particle  in  the  place
A  as  FG  X  GO  to  AH  X  HC  ;  that  is,  as  FC2  to  AC2  :  and  therefore
the  whole  power  of  all  the  particles  F,  in  their  proper  places  F,  will  be  to
the  power  of  the  like  number  of  particles  in  the  place  A  as  the  sum  of  all
the  FC2  to  the  sum  of  all  the  AC2,  that  is  (by  what  we  have  demonstrated
before),  as  1  to  2.  Q.E.D.
And  because  the  action  of  those  particles  is  exerted  in  the  direction  of
lines  perpendicularly  receding  from  the  plane  QR,  and  that  equally  from
each  side  of  this  plane,  they  will  wheel  about  the  circumference  of  the  circle
of  the  equator,  together  with  the  adherent  body  of  the  earth,  round  an  axis
which  lies  as  well  in  the  plane  QR  as  in  that  of  the  equator.
LEMMA  II.
The  same  things  still  supposed,  I  say,  in  the  second  place,  that  the  total
force  or  poiver  of  all  the  particles  situated  every  where  about  the  sphere
to  turn  the  earth  about  the  said  axis  is  to  the  whole  force  of  the  like
number  of  particles,  uniformly  disposed  round  the  whole  circumference,
of  the  equator  AE  in  the  fashion  of  a  ring,  to  turn  the  whole  earth
about  with  the  like  circular  motion,  as  2  to  5.
For  let  IK  be  any  lesser  circle  parallel  to
the  equator  AE,  and  let  L/  be  any  two  equal
particles  in  this  circle,  situated  without  the
sphere  Pape ;  and  if  upon  the  plane  QR,
which  is  at  right  angles  with  a  radius  drawn
to  the  sun.  we  let  fall  the  perpendiculars  LM,
Im,  the  total  forces  by  which  these  particles
recede  from  the  plane  QR  will  be  propor
tional  to  the  perpendiculars  LM,  Im.  Let
the  right  line  LZ  be  drawn  parallel  to  the
plane  Papc,  and  bisect  the  same  in  X ;  and
through  the  point  X  draw  Nw  parallel  to  the  plane  QR,  and  meeting  the
perpendiculars  LM,  Im,  in  N  and  n  •  and  upon  the  plane  QR  let  fall  the
perpendicular  XY.  And  the  contrary  forces  of  the  particles  L  and  I  to
wheel  about  the  earth  contrariwise  are  as  LM  X  MC,  and  Im  X  mC  ;  that
is,  as  LN  X  MC  +  NM  X  MC,  and  In  X  mC  —  nm  X  mG  •  or  LN  X
MC  +  NM  X  MC,  and  LN  x  mC  —  NM  X  mC,  and  LN  X  Mm  —
NM  X  MC"  4-  raC,  the  difference  of  the  two,  is  the  force  of  both  taken
together  to  turn  the  earth  round.  The  affirmative  part  of  this  difference
LN  X  MA/?,,  or  2LN  X  NX7  is  to  2AH  X  HC,  the  force  of  two  particles
of  the  same  size  situated  in  A,  as  LX2  to  AC'2  ;  and  the  negative  part  NM
BOOK   111.   OP     NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   45?
X  MC'T  wC^or  2XY  X  CY,  is  to  2AH  X  HC,  the  force  of  the  same
two  particles  situated  in  A,  as  CX2  to  AC2.  And  therefore  the  difference
of  the  parts,  that  is,  the  force  of  the  two  particles  L  and  /,  taken  together,
to  wheel  the  earth  about,  is  to  the  force  of  two  particles,  equal  to  the
former  and  situated  in  the  place  A,  to  turn  in  like  manner  the  earth  round,
as  LX2  —  CX2  to  AC2.  But  if  the  circumference  IK  of  the  circle  IK
is  supposed  to  be  divided  into  an  infinite  number  of  little  equal  parts  L,
all  the  LX2  will  be  to  the  like  number  of  IX2  as  1  to  2  (by  Lem.  1)  ;  and
to  the  same  number  of  AC2  as  IX2  to  2  AC2  ;  and  the  same  number  ol
CX2  to  as  many  AC2  as  2CX2  to  2AC2.  Wherefore  the  united  forcet
of  all  the  particles  in  the  circumference  of  the  circle  IK  are  to  the  joint
forces  of  as  many  particles  in  the  place  A  as  IX2  —  2CX2  to  2AC2  ;  and
therefore  (by  Lem.  1)  to  the  united  forces  of  as  many  particles  in  the  cir
cumference  of  the  circle  AE  as  IX2  —  2CX2  to  AC2.
Now  if  Pp.  the  diameter  of  the  sphere,  is  conceived  to  be  divided  into
an  infinite  number  of  equal  parts,  upon  which  a  like  number  of  circles
IK  are  supposed  to  insist,  the  matter  in  the  circumference  of  every  circle
£K  will  be  as  IX2  ;  and  therefore  the  force  of  that  matter  to  turn  the
earth  about  will  be  as  IX2  into  IX2  —  2CX2  :  and  the  force  of  the  same
matter,  if  it  was  situated  in  the  circumference  of  the  circle  AE,  would  be  as
IX2  into  AC2.  And  therefore  the  force  of  all  the  particles  of  the  whole
matter  situated  without  the  sphere  in  the  circumferences  of  all  the  circle?
is  to  the  force  of  the  like  number  of  particles  situated  in  the  circumfer
ence  of  the  greatest  circle  AE  as  all  the  IX2  into  IX2  —  2CX2  to  as
many  IX2  into  AC2  ;  that  is,  as  all  the  AC2  —  CX2  into  AC2  —  3CX2
to  as  many  AC2  —  CX2  into  AC2  :  that  is,  as  all  the  AC4  —  4AC2  x
CX2  +  3CX4  to  as  many  AC4  —AC2  X  CX2  ;  that  is,  as  the  whole
fluent  quantity,  whose  fluxion  is  AC4  —  4AC2  X  CX3  +  3CX4,  to  the
whole  fluent  quantity,  whose  fluxion  is  AC4  —  AC2  X  CX2  ;  and,  there
fore,  by  the  method  of  fluxions,  as  AC4  X  CX  —  fAC2  X  CX3  +
|CX.5  to  AC4  X  CX  —  i-AC2  X  CX3  ;  that  is,  if  for  CX  we  write  the
whole  Cp,  or  AC,  as  T4jAC5  to  f  AC5  ;  that  is,  as  2  to  5.  Q.E.D.
LEMMA  III.
The  same  things  still  supposed,  I  say,  in  the  third  place,  that  the  mo
tion  of  the  i^  hole  earth  about  the  axis  above-named  arising  from  the
motions  of  all  the  particles,  will  be  to  the  motion  of  the  aforesaid  ring
about  the  same  axis  in  a,  proportion  compounded  of  the  proportion  of
the  matter  in  the  earth  to  the  matter  in  the  ring  ;  and  the  proportion
of  three  squares  of  the  quadrantal  arc  of  any  circle  to  two  squares
of  its  diameter,  that  is,  in  the  proportion  of  the  matter  to  the  matter,
and  of  ttie  number  925275  to  the  number  1000000.
the  motion  of  a  cylinder  revolved  about  its  quiescent  axis  is  to  the
*68   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES   [BOOK    III.
motion  of  the  inscribed  sphere  revolved  together  with  it  as  any  four  equal
squares  to  three  circles  inscribed  in  three  of  those  squares  ;  and  the  mo
tion  of  this  cylinder  is  to  the  motion  of  an  exceedingly  thin  ring  sur
rounding  both  sphere  and  cylinder  in  their  common  contact  as  double  the
matter  in  the  cylinder  to  triple  the  matter  in  the  rir^j  ;  and  this  motion
of  the  ring,  uniformly  continued  about  the  axis  of  the  cylinder,  is  to  the
uniform  motion  of  the  same  about  its  own  diameter  performed  in  the
same  periodic  time  as  the  circumference  of  a  circle  to  double  its  diameter.
HYPOTHESIS  II.
If  the  other  parts  of  the  earth  were  taken  away,  and  the  remaining  ring
was  carried  alone  about  the  sun  in,  the  orbit  of  the  earth  by  the  annual
motion,  while  by  the  diurnal  motion  it  ivas  in  the  mean  time  revolved
about  its  own  axis  inclined  to  the  plane  of  t/te  ecliptic  by  an  angle
of  23i  decrees,  the  motion  of  the  equinoctial  points  would  be  the
same,  whether  the  ring  were  fluid,  or  whether  it  consisted  of  a  hard
and  rigid  matter.
PROPOSITION  XXXIX.     PROBLEM  XX.
To  Jin d  the  precession  of  the  equinoxes.
The  middle  horary  motion  of  the  moon's  nodes  in  a  circular  orbit,  when
the  nodes  are  in  the  quadratures,  was  16"  35'"  16iv.  36V. ;  the  half  of
which,  8"  17'"  38  v.  18V.  (for  the  reasons  above  explained)  is  the  mean  ho
rary  motion  of  the  nodes  in  such  an  orbit,  which  motion  in  a  whole  side
real  year  becomes  20°  11'  46".  Because,  therefore,  the  nodes  of  the  moon
in  such  an  orbit  would  be  yearly  transferred  20°  11'  46"  in  antecederttia  ;
and,  if  there  were  more  moons,  the  motion  of  the  nodes  of  every  one  (by
Cor.  16,  Pro]).  LXVI.  Book  1)  would  be  as  its  periodic  time;  if  upon  the
surface  of  the  earth  a  moon  was  revolved  in  the  time  of  a  sidereal  day,
the  annual  motion  of  the  nodes  of  this  moon  would  be  to  20°  31'  46"  as
23h.  56',  the  sidereal  day,  to  27  !.  7h.  43',  the  periodic  time  of  our  moon,
that  is,  as  1436  to  39343.  And  the  same  thing  would  happen  to  the
nodes  of  a  ring  of  moons  encompassing  the  earth,  whether  these  moons
did  not  mutually  touch  each  the  other,  or  whether  they  were  molten,  and
formed  into  a  continued  ring,  or  whether  that  ring  should  become  rigid
and  inflexible.
Let  us,  then,  suppose  that  this  ring  is  in  quantity  of  matter  equal  to
the  whole  exterior  earth  PctpAPepR,  which  lies  without  the  sphere  Pape
(see  fig.  Lem.  II) ;  and  because  this  sphere  is  to  that  exterior  earth  as  «C-
to  AC2  —  aC2,  that  is  (seeing  PC  or  «C  the  lea^t  semi-diameter  of  the
earth  is  to  AC  the  greatest  semi-diameter  of  the  same  as  229  to  230),  as
52441  to  459  :  if  this  ring  encompassed  the  earth  round  the  equator,  and
both  together  were  revolved  about  the  diameter  of  the  ring,  the  motion  of
HOOK    III.]   OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   459
the  ring  (by  Lcm.  Ill)  would  be  to  the  motion  of  the  inner  sphere  as  459
to  52441  and  1000000  to  925275  conjunct!},  that  is,  as  4590  to  485223;
and  therefore  the  motion  of  the  ring  would  be  to  the  sum  of  the  motions
of  both  ring  and  sphere  as  4590  to  489813.  Wherefore  if  the  ring  ad
heres  to  the  sphere,  and  communicates  its  motion  to  the  sphere,  by  which
its  nodes  or  equinoctial  points  recede,  the  motion  remaining  in  the  ring  will
be  to  its  former  motion  as  4590  to  489813;  upon  which  account  the
motion  of  the  equinoctial  points  will  be  diminished  in  the  same  propor
tion.  Wherefore  the  annual  motion  of  the  equinoctial  points  of  the  body,
composed  of  both  ring  and  sphere,  will  be  to  the  motion  20°  11'  46"  as
1436  to  39343  and  4590  to  489813  conjunctly,  that  is,  as  100  to  292369.
But  the  forces  by  which  the  nodes  of  a  number  of  moons  (as  we  explained
above),  and  therefore  by  which  the  equinoctial  points  of  the  ring  recede
(that  is,  the  forces  SIT,  in  fig.  Prop.  XXX),  are  in  the  several  particles
as  the  distances  of  those  particles  from  the  plane  Q,R  ;  and  by  these  forces
the  particles  recede  from  that  plane  :  and  therefore  (by  Lem.  II)  if  the
matter  of  the  ring  was  spread  all  over  the  surface  of  the  sphere,  after  the
fashion  of  the  figure  PupAPepl^,  in  order  to  make  up  that  exterior  part
of  the  earth,  the  total  force  or  power  of  all  the  particles  to  wheel  about
the  earth  round  any  diameter  of  the  equator,  and  therefore  to  move  the
equinoctial  points,  would  become  less  than  before  in  the  proportion  of  2  to
5.  Wherefore  the  annual  regress  of  the  equinoxes  now  would  be  to  20°
11'  46"  as  10  to  73092  ;  that  is.  would  be  9"  56'"  50iv.
But  because  the  plane  of  the  equator  is  inclined  to  that  of  the  ecliptic,
this  motion  is  to  be  diminished  in  the  proportion  of  the  sine  91706
(which  is  the  co-sine  of  23 1  deg.)  to  the  radius  100000  ;  and  the  remain
ing  motion  will  now  be  9"  7'"  20iv.  which  is  the  annual  precession  of  the
equinoxes  arising  from  the  force  of  the  sun.
But  the  force  of  the  moon  to  move  the  sea  was  to  the  force  of  the  sun
nearly  as  4,4815  to  1  ;  and  the  force  of  the  moon  to  move  the  equinoxes
is  to  that  of  the  sun  in  the  same  proportion.  Whenoe  the  annual  precession
of  the  equinoxes  proceeding  from  the  force  of  the  moon  comes  out  40"
52"'  521V.  and  the  total  annual  precession  arising  from  the  united  forces
of  both  will  be  50"  00"'  12iv.  the  quantity  of  which  motion  agrees  with
the  phaenomena  ;  for  the  precession  of  the  equinoxes,  by  astronomical  ob
servations,  is  about  50"  yearly.
If  the  height  of  the  earth  at  the  equator  exceeds  its  height  at  the
poles  by  more  than  17|  miles,  the  matter  thereof  will  be  more  rare  near
the  surface  than  at  the  centre  ;  and  the  precession  of  the  equinoxes  will
be  augmented  by  the  excess  of  height,  and  diminished  by  the  greater  rarity,
And  now  we  have  described  the  system  of  the  sun,  the  earth,  moon,
and  planets,  it  remains  that  we  add  something  about  the  comets.

That  the  comets  are  higher  tliau  tJie  moon,  and  in  the  regions  of  the
planets.
As  the  comets  were  placed  by  astronomers  above  the  moon,  because  they
were  found  to  have  no  diurnal  parallax,  so  their  annual  parallax  is  a  con
vincing  proof  of  their  descending  into  the  regions  of  the  planets ;  for  all
the  comets  which  move  in  a  direct  course  according  to  the  order  of  the
signs,  about  the  end  of  their  appearance  become  more  than  ordinarily  slow
or  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun  ;  and  more  than
ordinarily  swift,  if  the  earth  is  approaching  to  a  heliocentric  opposition
with  them  ;  whereas,  on  the  other  hand,  those  which  move  against  the  or
der  of  the  signs,  towards  the  end  of  their  appearance  appear  swifter  than
they  ought  to  be,  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun  ;  and  slower,
and  perhaps  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  in  the  other  side  of  its  orbit.  And
these  appearances  proceed  chiefly  from  the  diverse  situations  which  the
earth  acquires  in  the  course  of  its  motion,  after  the  same  manner  as  it  hap
pens  to  the  planets,  which  appear  sometimes  retrograde,  sometimes  more
slowly,  and  sometimes  more  swiftly,  progressive,  according  as  the  motion  of
the  earth  falls  in  with  that  of  the  planet,  or  is  directed  the  contrary  wav.
If  the  earth  move  the  same  way  with  the  comet,  but,  by  an  angular  motion
about  the  sun,  so  much  swifter  that  right  lines  drawn  from  the  earth  to
the  comet  converge  towards  the  parts  beyond  the  comet,  the  comet  seen
from  the  earth,  because  of  its  slower  motion,  will  appear  retrograde ;  and
even  if  the  earth  is  slower  than  the  comet,  the  motion  of  the  earth  being
subducted,  the  motion  of  the  comet  will  at  least  appear  retarded  ;  but  if  the
earth  tends  the  contrary  way  to  that  of  the  cornet,  the  motion  of  the  comet
will  from  thence  appear  accelerated;  and  from  this  apparent  acceleration,
or  retardation,  or  regressive  motion,  the  distance  of  the  comet  may  be  in-
F    c          B    A    ferred  in  this  manner.     Let  TQA,
TQ,B,  TQ,C,  be  three  observed  lon
gitudes  of  the  comet  about  the  time
of  its  first  appearing,  and  TQ,F  its
last  observed  longitude  before  its
disappearing.  Draw  the  right  line
ABC,  whose  parts  AB,  BC,  inter-
cepted  between  the  right  lines  QA
and  Q.B,  QB  and  Q.C,  may  be  one  to  the  other  as  the  two  times  between
the  three  first  observations.  Produce  AC  to  G,  so  as  AG  may  be  to  A  B
as  the  time  between  the  first  and  last  observation  to  the  time  between  the
first  and  second  ;  and  join  Q.G.  Now  if  the  comet  did  move  uniformly  in
a  right  line,  and  the  earth  either  stood  still,  or  was  likewise  carried  for-
u  ards  in  a  right  line  by  an  uniform  motion,  the  angle  TQG  would  be  tht
BOOK    111.]   OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   401
longitude  of  the  comet  at  the  time  of  the  last  observation.  The  angle,
therefore,  FQG,  which  is  the  difference  of  the  longitude,  proceeds  from  the
inequality  of  the  motions  of  the  comet  and  the  earth ;  and  this  angle,  if
the  earth  and  cornet  move  contrary  ways,  is  added  to  the  angle  TQ,G,  and
accelerates  the  apparent  motion  of  the  comet  ;  but  if  the  comet  move  the
same  way  with  the  earth,  it  is  subtracted,  and  either  retards  the  motion  ol
the  comet,  or  perhaps  renders  it  retrograde,  as  we  have  but  now  explained.
This  angle,  therefore,  proceeding  chiefly  from  the  motion  of  the  earth,  is
justly  to  be  esteemed  the  parallax  of  the  comet;  neglecting,  to  wit,  some
little  increment  or  decrement  that  may  arise  from  the  unequal  motion  of
the  comet  in  its  orbit :  and  from  this  parallax  we  thus  deduce  the  distance
of  the  comet.  Let  S  represent  the  sun,  acT  v
the  orbis  tnagnus,  a  the  earth's  place  in  the
first  observatiun,  c  the  place  of  the  earth  in
the  third  observation,  T  the  place  of  the
earth  in  the  last  observation,  and  TT  a  right
line  drawn  to  the  beginning  of  Aries.  Set
off  the  angle  TTV  equal  to  the  angle  TQF,
that  is,  equal  to  the  longitude  of  the  comet
at  the  time  when  the  earth  is  in  T ;  join  ac,
and  produce  it  to  g1,  so  as  ag  may  be  to  ac
as  AG  to  AC  ;  and  g  will  be  the  place  at
which  the  earth  would  have  arrived  in  the
time  of  the  last  observation,  if  it  had  con
tinued  to  move  uniformly  in  the  right  line
ac.  Wherefore,  if  we  draw  g'T  parallel  to  TT,  and  make  the  angle  T^V
equal  to  the  angle  TQ,G,  this  angle  Tg\  will  be  equal  to  the  longitude  of
the  comet  seen  from  the  place  g,  and  the  angle  TVg-  will  be  the  parallax
which  arises  from  the  earth's  being  transferred  from  the  place  g  into  the
place  T ;  and  therefore  V  will  be  the  place  of  the  comet  in  the  plane  of  the
ecliptic.  And  this  place  V  is  commonly  lower  than  the  orb  of  Jupiter.
The  same  thing  may  be  deduced  from  the  incurvation  of  the  way  of  the
comets  ;  for  these  bodies  move  almost  in  great  circles,  while  their  velocity
is  great ;  but  about  the  end  of  their  course,  when  that  part  of  their  appa
rent  motion  which  arises  from  the  parallax  bears  a  greater  proportion  to
their  whole  apparent  motion,  they  commonly  deviate  from  those  circles,  and
when  the  earth  goes  to  one  side,  they  deviate  to  the  other :  and  this  deflex
ion,  because  of  its  corresponding  with  the  motion  of  the  earth,  must  arise
chiefly  from  the  parallax ;  and  the  quantity  thereof  is  so  considerable,  as,
by  my  computation,  to  place  the  disappearing  comets  a  good  deal  lower
than  Jupiter.  Whence  it  follows  that  when  they  approach  nearer  to  us  in
their  perigees  and  perihelions  they  often  descend  below  the  orbs  of  Mare
and  the  inferior  planets.
462   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES   [BOOK    JJI,
The  near  approach  of  the  comets  is  farther  confirmed  from  the  light  of
tb.eir  heads;  for  the  light  of  a  celestial  body,  illuminated  by  the  sun,  and
receding  to  remote  parts,  is  diminished  in  the  quadruplicate  proportion  of
the  distance;  to  wit,  in  one  duplicate  proportion,  on  account  of  the  increase
of  the  distance  from  the  sun,  and  in  another  duplicate  proportion,  on  ac
count  of  the  decrease  of  the  apparent  diameter.  Wherefore  if  both  the
quantity  of  light  and  the  apparent  diameter  of  a  comet  are  given,  its  dis
tance  will  be  also  given,  by  taking  the  distance  of  the  comet  to  the  distance
of  ;i  planet  in  the  direct  proportion  of  their  diameters  and  the  reciprocal
subduplicate  proportion  of  their  lights.  Thus,  in  the  comet  of  the  year
1682,  Mr.  Flamsted  observed  with  a  telescope  of  16  feet,  and  measured
with  a  micrometer,  the  least  diameter  of  its  head;  2'  00;  but  the  nucleus
or  star  in  the  middle  of  the  head  scarcely  amounted  to  the  tenth  part  of
this  measure;  and  therefore  its  diameter  was  only  11"  or  12"  •  but  in  the
light  and  splendor  of  its  head  it  surpassed  that  of  the  comet  in  the  year
1680;  and  might  be  compared  with  the  stars  of  the  lirst  or  second  magni
tude.  Let  us  suppose  that  Saturn  with  its  ring  was  about  four  times  more
lucid ;  and  because  the  light  of  the  ring  was  almost  equal  to  the  light  of
the  globe  within,  and  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  globe  is  about  21",  and
therefore  the  united  light  of  both  globe  and  ring  would  be  equal  to  the
light  of  a  globe  whose  diameter  is  30",  it  follows  that  the  distance  of  th
comet  was  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  as  1  to  v/4  inversely,  and  12"  to  30
directly ;  that  is,  as  24  to  30,  or  4  to  5.  Again ;  the  comet  in  the  month
of  April  1665,  as  Hevelius  informs  us,  excelled  almost  all  the  fixed  stars
in  splendor,  and  even  Saturn  itself,  as  being  of  a  much  more  vivid  colour ;
for  this  comet  was  more  lucid  than  that  other  which  had  appeared  about
the  end  of  the  preceding  year,  and  had  been  compared  to  the  stars  of  the
h'rst  magnitude.  The  diameter  of  its  head  was  about  6' ;  but  the  nucleus,
compared  with  the  planets  by  means  of  a  telescope,  was  plainly  less  than
Jupiter ;  and  sometimes  judged  less,  sometimes  judged  equal,  to  the  globe
of  Saturn  within  the  ring.  Since,  then,  the  diameters  of  the  heads  of  the
comets  seldom  exceed  8'  or  12;,  and  the  diameter  of  the  nucleus  or  central
star  is  but  about  a  tenth  or  perhaps  fifteenth  part  of  the  diameter  of  the
head,  it  appears  that  these  stars  are  generally  of  about  the  same  apparent
magnitude  with  the  planets.  But  in  regard  that  their  light  may  be  often
compared  with  the  light  of  Saturn,  yea,  and  sometimes  exceeds  it,  it  is  evi
dent  that  all  comets  in  their  perihelions  must  either  be  placed  below  or  not
far  above  Saturn  ;  and  they  are  much  mistaken  who  remove  them  almost
as  far  as  the  fixed  stars ;  for  if  it  was  so,  the  comets  could  receive  no  more
light  from  our  sun  than  our  planets  do  from  the  fixed  stars.
So  far  we  have  gone,  without  considering  the  obscuration  which  comets
suffer  from  that  plenty  of  thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads,
and  through  which  the  heads  always  shew  dull,  as  through  i  cloud;  for  by
BoOK  Hl.J   Or    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.   463
how  much  the  more  a  body  is  obscured  by  this  smoke,  by  so  much  the  more
near  it  must  be  allowed  to  come  to  the  sun,  that  it  may  vie  with  the  plan-
eta  in  the  quantity  of  light  which  it  reflects.  Whence  it  is  probable  that
the  comets  descend  far  below  the  orb  of  Saturn,  as  we  proved  before  frou
their  parallax.  But,  above  all,  the  thing  is  evinced  from  their  tails,  which
must  be  owing  either  to  the  sun's  light  reflected  by  a  smoke  arising  from
them,  and  dispersing  itself  through  the  aether,  or  to  the  light  of  their  own
heads.  In  the  former  case,  we  must  shorten  the  distance  of  the  comets,
lest  we  be  obliged  to  allow  that  the  smoke  arising  from  their  heads  is
propagated  through  such  a  vast  extent  of  space,  and  with  such  a  velocity
and  expansion  as  will  seem  altogether  incredible  ;  in  the  latter  case,  the
whole  light  of  both  head  arid  tail  is  to  be  ascribed  to  the  central  nucleus.
But.  then,  if  we  suppose  all  this  light  to  be  united  and  condensed  within
the  disk  of  the  nucleus,  certainly  the  nucleus  will  by  far  exceed  Jupiter
itself  in  splendor,  especially  when  it  emits  a  very  large  and  lucid  tail  If.
therefore,  under  a  less  apparent  diameter,  it  reflects  more  light,  it  must  be
much  more  illuminated  by  the  sun,  and  therefore  much  nearer  to  it;  and
the  same  argument  will  bring  down  the  heads  of  comets  sometimes  within
the  orb  of  Venus,  viz.,  when,  being  hid  under  the  sun's  rays,  they  emit  such
huge  and  splendid  tails,  like  beams  of  fire,  as  sometimes  they  do  ;  for  if  all
that  light  was  supposed  to  be  gathered  together  into  one  star,  it  would
sometimes  exceed  not  one  Venus  only,  but  a  great  many  such  united
into  one.
Lastly  ;  the  same  thing  is  inferred  from  the  light  of  the  heads,  which
increases  in  the  recess  of  the  cornets  from  the  earth  towards  the  sun,  and
decreases  in  their  return  from  the  sun  towards  the  earth  ;  for  so  the  comet
of  the  year  1665  (by  the  observations  of  Hevelius],  from  the  time  that  it
was  first  seen,  was  always  losing  of  its  apparent  motion,  and  therefore  had
already  passed  its  perigee  ;  but  yet  the  splendor  of  its  head  was  daily  in
creasing,  till,  being  hid  under  the  sun's  rays,  the  comet  ceased  to  appear.
The  comet  of  the  year  1683  (by  the  observations  of  the  same  LJevelius),
about  the  end  of  July,  when  it  first  appeared,  moved  at  a  very  slow  rate,
advancing  only  about  40  or  45  minutes  in  its  orb  in  a  day's  time  ;  but
from  that  time  its  diurnal  motion  was  continually  upon  the  increase,  till
September  4,  when  it  arose  to  about  5  degrees  ;  and  therefore,  in  all  this
interval  of  time,  the  comet  was  approaching  to  the  earth.  Which  is  like
wise  proved  from  the  diameter  of  its  head,  measured  with  a  micrometer  ;
for,  August  6,  Hevelius  found  it  only  6'  05",  including  the  coma,  which,
September  2  he  observed  to  be  9'  07",  and  therefore  its  head  appeared  far
less  about,  the  beginning  than  towards  the  end  of  the  motion  ;  though
about  the  beginning,  because  nearer  to  the  sun,  it  appeared  far  more  lucid
than  towards  the  end,  as  the  same  Hevelius  declares.  Wherefore  in  all
this  interval  of  time,  on  account  of  its  recess  from  the  sun,  it  decreases
464   THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES   [BOOK    III.
in  splendor,  notwithstanding  its  access  towards  the  earth.  The  comet  of
the  year  1618,  about  the  middle  of  December,  and  that  of  the  year  1680,
about  the  end  of  the  same  month,  did  both  move  with  their  greatest  velo
city,  and  were  therefore  then  in  their  perigees  :  but  the  greatest  splendor
of  their  heads  was  seen  two  weeks  before,  when  they  had  just  got  clear  of
the  sun's  rays  ;  and  the  greatest  splendor  of  their  tails  a  little  more  early,
when  yet  nearer  to  the  sun.  The  head  of  the  former  comet  (according  to
the  observations  of  Cysdtus],  Dece/itber  1,  appeared  greater  than  the  stars
of ^ the  first  magnitude:  and,  December  16  (then  in  the  perigee),  it  was
but  little  diminished  in  magnitude,  but  in  the  splendor  and  brightness  of
its  light  a  great  deal.  January  7,  Kepler,  being  uncertain  about  the
head,  left  oif  observing.  December  12,  the  head  of  the  latter  comet  was
seen  and  observed  by  Mr.  Flamsted,  when  but  9  degrees  distant  from  the
sun  ;  which  is  scarcely  to  be  done  in  a  star  of  the  third  magnitude.  De
cember  15  and  17,  it  appeared  as  a  star  of  the  third  magnitude,  its  lustre
being  diminished  by  the  brightness  of  the  clouds  near  the  setting  sun.
December  26,  when  it  moved  with  the  greatest  velocity,  being  almost  in
its  perigee,  it  was  less  than  the  mouth  of  Pegasus,  a  star  of  the  third
magnitude.  January  3,  it  appeared  as  a  star  of  the  fourth.  January  9,
as  one  of  the  fifth.  January  13,  it  was  hid  by  the  splendor  of  the  moon,
then  in  her  increase.  January  25,  it  was  scarcely  equal  to  the  stars  of
the  seventh  magnitude.  If  we  compare  equal  intervals  of  time  on  one
side  and  on  the  other  from  the  perigee,  we  shall  find  that  the  head  of  the
comet,  which  at  both  intervals  of  time  was  far,  but  yet  equally,  removed
from  the  earth,  and  should  have  therefore  shone  with  equal  splendor,  ap
peared  brightest  on  the  side  of  the  perigee  towards  the  sun,  and  disap
peared  on  the  other.  Therefore,  from  the  great  difference  of  light  in  the
one  situation  and  in  the  other,  we  conclude  the  great  vicinity  of  the  sun
and  comet  in  the  former  ;  for  the  light  of  comets  uses  to  be  regular,  and
to  appear  greatest  when  the  heads  move  fastest,  and  are  therefore  in  their
perigees ;  excepting  in  so  far  as  it  is  increased  by  their  nearness  to  the
sun.  -
COR.  1.  Therefore  the  comets  shine  by  the  sun's  light,  which  they  reflect.
COR.  2.  From  what  has  been  said,  we  may  likewise  understand  why
comets  are  so  frequently  seen  in  that  hemisphere  in  which  the  sun  is,  and
so  seldom  in  the  other.  If  they  were  visible  in  the  regions  far  above
Saturn,  they  would  appear  more  frequently  in  the  parts  opposite  to  the
sun  ;  for  such  as  were  in  those  parts  would  be  nearer  to  the  earth,  whereas
the  presence  of  the  sun  must  obscure  and  hide  those  that  appear  in  the
hemisphere  in  which  he  is.  Yet,  looking  over  the  history  of  comets,  I
find  that  four  or  five  times  more  have  been  seen  in  the  hemisphere  towards
the  sun  than  in  the  opposite  hemisphere  ;  besides,  without  doubt,  not  a
few,  which  have  been  hid  by  the  light  of  the  sun  :  for  comets  descending

into  our  parts  neither  emit  tails,  nor  are  so  well  illuminated  by  the  sun,
as  to  discover  themselves  to  our  naked  eyes,  until  they  are  come  nearer  to
us  than  Jupiter.  But  the  far  greater  part  of  that  spherical  space,  which
is  described  about  the  sun  with  so  small  an  interval,  lies  on  that  side  of
the  earth  which  regards  the  sun  ;  and  the  comets  in  that  greater  part  are
commonly  more  strongly  illuminated,  as  being  for  the  most  part  nearer  to
the  sun.
COR.  3.  Hence  also  it  is  evident  that  the  celestial  spaces  are  void  of
resistance  ;  for  though  the  comets  are  carried  in  oblique  paths,  and  some
times  contrary  to  the  course  of  the  planets,  yet  they  move  every  way  with
the  greatest  freedom,  and  preserve  their  motions  for  an  exceeding  long
time,  even  where  contrary  to  the  course  of  the  planets.  I  am  out  in  my
judgment  if  they  are  not  a  sort  of  planets  revolving  in  orbits  returning
into  themselves  with  a  perpetual  motion  ;  for,  as  to  what  some  writers
contend,  that  they  are  no  other  than  meteors,  led  into  this  opinion  by  the
perpetual  changes  that  happen  to  their  heads,  it  seems  to  have  no  founda
tion  ;  for  the  heads  of  comets  are  encompassed  with  huge  atmospheres,
and  the  lowermost  parts  of  these  atmospheres  must  be  the  densest  ;  and
therefore  it  is  in  the  clouds  only,  not  in  the  bodies  of  the  comets  them
selves,  that  these  changes

In  a  letter  of  mine  to  Mr.  /.  Collins,  dated  December  10,  1672,  having
described  a  method  of  tangents,  which  I  suspected  to  be  the  same  with
Slusius*s  method,  which  at  that  time  wag  not  made  public,  I  subjoined  these
words  •  This  is  one  particular,  or  rather  a  Corollary,  of  a  general  nte

to  the  drawing  of  tangents  to  any  curve  lines,  whether  geometrical  or
mechanical,  or  any  how  respecting  right  lines  or  other  cnrves,  but  also
to  the  resolving  other  abstrnser  kinds  of  problems  about  the  crookedness,
areas,  lengths,  centres  of  gravity  of  curves,  &c. ;  nor  is  it  (as  Hudd^ri's
method  de  Maximis  &  Minimia)  limited  to  equations  which  are  free  from
surd  quantities.  This  method  I  have  interwoven  with  that  other  oj
working  in  equations,  by  reducing  them  to  infinite  serie?.  So  far  that
letter.  And  these  last  words  relate  to  a  treatise  I  composed  on  that  sub
ject  in  the  year  1671.  The  foundation  of  that  general  method  is  contain
ed  in  the  preceding  Lemma.
PROPOSITION  VIII.     THEOREM  VI.
If  a  body  in  an  uniform  medium,  being  uniformly  acted  upon  by  the  force
of  gravity,  ascends  or  descends  in  a  right  line  ;  and  the  whole  space
described  be  distinguished  into  equal  parts,  and  in  the  beginning  of
each  of  the  parts  (by  adding  or  subducting  the  resisting  force  of  the
medium  to  or  from  the  force  of  gravity,  when  the  body  ascends  or  de
scends]  yon  collect  the  absolute  forces  ;  I  say,  that  those  absolute  forces
ire  in  a  geometrical  progression.
For  let  the  force  of  gravity  be  expounded  by  the
given  line  AC  ;  the  force  of  resistance  by  the  indefi
nite  line  AK  ;  the  absolute  force  in  the  descent  of  the
body  by  the  difference  KC  :  the  velocity  of  the  I  tody
<^LKJL&i>F/  by  a  line  AP,  which  shall  be  a  mean  proportional  be
tween  AK  and  AC,  and  therefore  in  a  subduplicate  ratio  of  the  resistance;
the  increment  of  the  resistance  made  in  a  given  particle  of  time  by  the  li-
neola  KL,  and  the  contemporaneous  increment  of  the  velocity  by  the  li-
neola  PQ  ;  and  with  the  centre  C,  and  rectangular  asymptotes  CA,  CH,
describe  any  hyperbola  BNS  meeting  the  erected  perpendiculars  AB,  KN,
LO  in  B,  N  and  O.  Because  AK  is  as  AP2 ,  the  moment  KL  of  the  one  will
be  as  the  moment  2APQ  of  the  other,  that  is,  as  AP  X  KC  ;  for  the  in
crement  PQ  of  the  velocity  is  (by  Law  II)  proportional  to  the  generating
force  KC.  Let  the  ratio  of  KL  be  compounded  with  the  ratio  KN,  and
the  rectangle  KL  X  KN  will  become  as  AP  X  KC  X  KN  ;  that  is  (because
the  rectangle  KC  X  KN  is  given),  as  AP.  But  the  ultimate  ratio  of  the
hyperbolic  area  KNOL  to  the  rectangle  KL  X  KN  becomes,  when  the
points  K  and  L  coincide,  the  ratio  of  equality.  Therefore  that  hyperbolic
evanescent  area  is  as  AP.  Therefore  the  whole  hyperbolic  area  ABOL
is  composed  of  particles  KNOL  which  are  always  proportional  to  the
velocity  AP;  and  therefore  is  itself  proportional  to  the  space  described
with  that  velocity.  Let  ,that  area  be  now  divided  into  equal  parts

as  ABMI,  IMNK,  KNOL,  (fee.,  and  the  absolute  forces  AC,  1C,  KC,  LC,
(fee.,  will  be  in  a  geometrical  progression.  Q,.E.D.  And  by  a  like  rea
soning,  in  the  ascent  of  the  body,  taking,  on  the  contrary  side  of  the  point
A,  the  equal  areas  AB?m,  i/nnk,  knol,  (fee.,  it  will  appear  that  the  absolute
forces  AC.  iG,  kC,  1C,  (fee.,  are  continually  proportional.  Therefore  if  all
the  spaces  in  the  ascent  and  descent  are  taken  equal,  all  the  absolute  forces
1C,  kC,  iC,  AC,  1C,  KC,  LC,  (fee.,  will  be  continually  proportional.  Q,.E.D.
COR.  1.  Hence  if  the  space  described  be  expounded  by  the  hyperbolic
area  ABNK,  the  force  of  gravity,  the  velocity  of  the  body,  and  the  resist
ance  of  the  medium,  may  be  expounded  by  the  lines  AC,  AP,  and  AK  re
spectively  •  and  vice  versa.
COR.  2.  And  the  greatest  velocity  which  the  body  can  ever  acquire  in
an  infinite  descent  will  be  expounded  by  the  line  AC.
COR.  3.  Therefore  if  the  resistance  of  the  medium  answering  to  any
given  velocity  be  known,  the  greatest  velocity  will  be  found,  by  taking  it
to  that  given  velocity  in  a  ratio  subduplicate  of  the  ratio  which  the  force
of  gravity  bears  to  that  known  resistance  of  the  medium.
PROPOSITION  IX.     THEOREM  VII.
Supposing  ivhat  is  above  demonstrated,  I  say,  that  if  the  tangents  of  t-he
angles  of  the  sector  of  a  circle,  and  of  an  hyperbola,  be  taken  propor
tional  to  the  velocities,  the  radius  being  of  a  fit  magnitude,  all  the  time
of  the  ascent  to  the  highest  place  icill  be  as  the  sector  of  the  circle,  and
all  the  time  of  descending  from  the  highest  place  as  the  sector  of  t/ie
hyperbola.
To   the   right   line   AC,  which   ex
presses  the  force  of  gravity,  let  AD
drawn  perpendicular  and  equal.     From
the   centre    D  with  the  semi-diameter
AD  describe  as  well  the  cmadrant  A^E
-t
of  a  circle,  as  the  rectangular  hyper
bola  AVZ,  whose  axis  is  AK,  principal
vertex  A,  and  asymptote  DC.  Let  Dp,
DP  be  drawn  ;  and  the  circular  sector
AtD  will  be  as  all  the  time  of  the  as
cent  to  the  highest  place ;  and  the  hy
perbolic  sector  ATD  as  all  the  time  of  descent  from  the  highest  place;  ii
BO  be  that  the  tangents  Ap,  AP  of  those  sectors  be  as  the  velocities.
CASE  1.  Draw  Dvq  cutting  off  the  moments  or  least  particles  tDv  and
^  ?,  described  in  the  same  time,  of  the  sector  ADt  and  of  the  triangle
AD/?.  Since  those  particles  (because  of  the  common  angle  D)  are  in  a  du
plicate  ratio  of  the  sides,  the  particle  tDv  will  be  as  — -^-^-— ,  that  is
266  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES

(because  tD  is  given),  as  ^f.  But  joD8  is  AD3  +  Ap2,  that  is,  AD2  -h
AD  X  AA-,  or  AD  X  Gk ;  and  (/Dp  is  1  AD  X  pq.  Therefore  tDv,  the
BO
particle  of  the  sector,  is  as  ^ ,  ;  that  is,  as  the  least  decrement  pq  of  the
velocity  directly,  and  the  force  Gk  which  diminishes  the  velocity,  inversely ;
and  therefore  as  the  particle  of  time  answering  to  the  decrement  of  the  ve
locity.  And,  by  composition,  the  sum  of  all  the  particles  tDv  in  the  sector
AD/  will  be  as  the  sum  of  the  particles  of  time  answering  to  each  of  the
lost  particles  pq  of  the  decreasing  velocity  Ap,  till  that  velocity,  being  di
minished  into  nothing,  vanishes;  that  is,  the  whole  sector  AD/  is  as  the
whole  time  of  ascent  to  the  highest  place.  Q.E.D.
CASE  2.  Draw  DQV  cutting  off  the  least  particles  TDV  and  PDQ  of
the  sector  DAV,  and  of  the  triangle  DAQ  ;  and  these  particles  will  be  to
each  other  as  DT2  to  DP2,  that  is  (if  TX  and  AP  are  parallel),  as  DX2
to  DA2  or  TX2  to  AP2  ;  and,  by  division,  as  DX2  —  TX2  to  DA2  -
AP2.  But.  from  the  nature  of  the  hyperbola,  DX2  — TX2  is  AD2  ;  and,  by
the  supposition,  AP2  is  AD  X  AK.  Therefore  the  particles  are  to  each
other  as  AD2  to  AD2  —  AD  X  AK  ;  that  is,  as  AD  to  AD  —  AK  or  AC
;  and
to  CK  :  and  therefore  the  particle  TDV  of  the  sector  is  -
PQ
therefore  (because  AC  and  AD  are  given)  as
CK
that  is,  as  the  increment
of  the  velocity  directly,  and  as  the  force  generating  the  increment  inverse
ly  ;  and  therefore  as  the  particle  of  the  time  answering  to  the  increment.
And,  by  composition,  the  sum  of  the  particles  of  time,  in  which  all  the  par
ticles  PQ  of  the  velocity  A  I3  are  generated,  will  be  as  the  sum  of  the  par
ticles  of  the  sector  ATI)  ;  that  is,  the  whole  time  will  be  as  the  whole
sector.  Q.E.D.  COR.  1.  Hence  if  AB  be  equal  to  a
fourth  part  of  AC,  the  space  which  a  body
will  describe  by  falling  in  any  time  will
be  to  the  space  which  the  body  could  de
scribe,  by  moving  uniform]}'  on  in  the
same  time  with  its  greatest  velocity
AC,  as  the  area  ABNK,  which  ex
presses  the  space  described  in  falling  to
the  area  ATD,  which  expresses  the
time.  For  since  AC  is  to  AP  as  AP
_   to  AK,  then  (by  Cor.  1,  Lem.  II,  of  this
Book)  LK  is  to  PQ  as  2AK  to  AP,  that  is,  as  2AP  to  AC,  and  thence
LK  is  to  ^PQ  as  AP  to  JAC  or  AB  ;  and  KN  is  to  AC  or  AD  as  AB  tc

UK  ;  and  therefore,  ex  cequo,  LKNO  to  DPQ,  as  AP  to  CK.  But  DPQ
was  to  DTV  as  CK  to  AC.  Therefore,  ex  aquo,  LKNO  is  to  DTV  r,?
AP  to  AC ;  that  is,  as  the  velocity  of  the  falling  body  to  the  greatest
velocity  which  the  body  by  falling  can  acquire.  Since,  therefore,  the
moments  LKNO  and  DTV  of  the  areas  ABNK  and  ATD  are  as  the  ve
locities,  all  the  parts  of  those  areas  generated  in  the  same  time  will  be  as
the  spaces  described  in  the  same  time  ;  and  therefore  the  whole  areas  ABNK
and  ADT,  generated  from  the  beginning,  will  be  as  the  whole  spaces  de
scribed  from  the  beginning  of  the  descent.  Q.E.D.
COR.  2.  The  same  is  true  also  of  the  space  described  in  the  ascent.
That  is  to  say,  that  all  that  space  is  to  the  space  described  in  the  same
time,  with  the  uniform  velocity  AC,  as  the  area  ABttk  is  to  the  sector  ADt.
COR.  3.  The  velocity  of  the  body,  falling  in  the  time  ATD,  is  to  the
velocity  which  it  would  acquire  in  the  same  time  in  a  non-resisting  space,
as  the  triangle  APD  to  the  hyperbolic  sector  ATD.  For  the  velocity  in
a  non-resisting  medium  Avould  be  as  the  time  ATD,  and  in  a  resisting  me
dium  is  as  AP,  that  is,  as  the  triangle  APD.  And  those  velocities,  at  the
beginning  of  the  descent,  are  equal  among  themselves,  as  well  as  those
areas  ATD,  APD.
COR.  4.  By  the  same  argument,  the  velocity  in  the  ascent  is  to  the  ve
locity  with  which  the  body  in  the  same  time,  in  a  non-resisting  space,  would
lose  all  its  motion  of  ascent,  as  the  triangle  ApD  to  the  circular  sector
AtD  ;  or  as  the  right  line  Ap  to  the  arc  At.
COR.  5.  Therefore  the  time  in  which  a  body,  by  falling  in  a  resisting
medium,  would  acquire  the  velocity  AP,  is  to  the  time  in  which  it  would
acquire  its  greatest  velocity  AC,  by  falling  in  a  non-resisting  space,  as  the
sector  ADT  to  the  triangle  ADC  :  and  the  time  in  which  it  would  lose  its
velocity  Ap,  by  ascending  in  a  resisting  medium,  is  to  the  time  in  which
it  would  lose  the  same  velocity  by  ascending  in  a  non-resisting  space,  as
the  arc  At  to  its  tangent  Ap.
COR.  6.  Hence  from  the  given  time  there  is  given  the  space  described  in
the  ascent  or  descent.  For  the  greatest  velocity  of  a  body  descending  in
wfinitum  is  given  (by  Corol.  2  and  3,  Theor.  VI,  of  this  Book)  ;  and  thence
the  time  is  given  in  which  a  body  would  acquire  that  velocity  by  falling
in  a  non-resisting  space.  And  taking  the  sector  ADT  or  ADt  to  the  tri
angle  ADC  in  the  ratio  of  the  given  time  to  the  time  just  now  found,
there  will  be  given  both  the  velocity  AP  or  Ap,  and  the  area  ABNK  or
AB//&,  which  is  to  the  sector  ADT,  or  AD/,  as  the  space  sought  to  the
space  which  would,  in  the  given  time,  be  uniformly  described  with  that
greatest  velocity  found  just  before.
COR.  7.  And  by  going  backward,  from  the  given  space  of  ascent  or  de
scent  AB»?A:  or  ABNK,  there  will  be  given  the  time  AD*  or  ADT.

PROPOSITION  X.     PROBLEM  III.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the
medium  in  each  place.
Let  PQ  be  a  plane  perpendicular  to
the  plane  of  the  scheme  itself;  PFHQ
a  curve  line  meeting  that  plane  in  the
points  P  and  Q ;  G,  H,  I,  K  four
places  of  the  body  going  on  in  this
\  curve  from  F  to  Q ;  and  GB,  HC,  ID,
KE  four  parallel  ordinates  let  fall
p   A.      33    c^D  E   Q  from  these  points  to  the  horizon,  and
standing  on  the  horizontal  line  PQ  at  the  points  B,  C,  D,  E ;  and  let  the
distances  BC,  CD,  DE,  of  the  ordinates  be  equal  among  themselves.  From
the  points  G  and  H  let  the  right  lines  GL,  HN,  be  drawn  touching  the
curve  in  G  and  H,  and  meeting  the  ordinates  CH,  DI,  produced  upwards,
in  L  and  N  :  and  complete  the  parallelogram  HCDM.  And  the  times  in
which  the  body  describes  the-  arcs  GH,  HI,  will  be  in  a  subduplicate  ratio
of  the  altitudes  LH,  NI;  which  the  bodies  would  describe  in  those  times,
by  falling  from  the  tangents;  and  the  velocities  will  be  as  the  lengths  de
scribed  GH,  HI  directly,  and  the  times  inversely.  Let  the  times  be  ex-
C*TT          TTT
pounded  by  T  and  t,  and  the  velocities  by  —•=-  and  ---;  and  the  decrement J_   L  /-^TT   TTT
of  the  velocity  produced  in  the  time  t  will  be  expounded  by  -7^    — .
This  decrement  arises  from  the  resistance  which  retards  the  body,  and  from
the  gravity  which  accelerates  it.  Gravity,  in  a  falling  body,  which  in  its
fall  describes  the  space  NI,  produces  a  velocity  with  which  it  would  be  able
to  describe  twice  that  space  in  the  same  time,  as  Galileo  has  demonstrated  ;
2NI
that  is,  the  velocity  :  but  if  the  body  describes  the  arc  HI,  it  augments
MIxNl
HI —  ;   and  therefore  generates that  arc  only  by  the  length  HI  —  HN  or
only  the  velocity  —    iff—-     Let  this  velocity  be  added  to  the  before- t  X   H.JL

arising  from   the  resistance  alone,   that  is,   -^    : — h T

2NI.
Therefore  since,  in  the  same  time,  the  action  of  gravity  generates,  in  a  fall
ing  body,  the  velocity     ,  the  resistance  will  be  to  the  gravity  as  7^

Now  for  the  abscissas  CB,  CD,

Qo  +  Ro2  +  So3  +,  &c.  And  all
the  terms  of  the  series  after  the  first,
that  is,  Ro2  +  So3  +,  (fee.,  will  be

(fee.,  P  —  2Qo—  4Ro2—  SSo3— ,  (fee.,  and  P  -\-  Qo  —  Ro2  +  So3—,

CH  and  CH  —  DI,  and  to  the  squares  thence  produced  adding  the  squares
of  BC  and  CD  themselves,  you  will  have  oo  -f-  QQoo  —  2QRo3  +,  (fee.,

are  proportional  to  the  lineolae  LH  and  NI,  and  therefore  in  the  duplicate
ratio  of  the  infinitely  small  times  T  and  t :  and  thence  the  ratio  ~,  is   ^

the  values  of  ™,    GH,    HI,   MI   and   NI  just  found,   becomes   -^- J-   /w-Lt/

gravity  as  --     TT'Q     to  2Roo>  that  is>  as  3S      r   to  4RR.
And  the  velocity  will  be  such,  that  a  body  going  off  therewith  from  any
place  H,  in  the  direction  of  the  tangent  HN,  would  describe,  in  vacuo,  a
parabola,  whose  diameter  is  HC,  and  its  latus  rectum    NT    or  --  ^  ----  .
And  the  resistance  is  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the  square  of
the  velocity  conjunctly  ;  and  therefore  the  density  of  the  medium  is  as  the
resistance  directly,  and  the  square  of  the  velocity  inversely  ;  that  is,  as

Such  series  I  distinguish  into  successive  terms  after  this  manner  :  I  call
that  the  first  term  in  which  the  infinitely  small  quantity  o  is  not  found  ;
the  second,  in  which  that  quantity  is  of  one  dimension  only ;  the  third,  in
which  it  arises  to  two  dimensions  ;  the  fourth,  in  which  it  is  of  three  ;  and
so  ad  infinitum.  And  the  first  term,  which  here  is  e,  will  always  denote
the  length  of  the  ordinate  CH,  standing  at  the  beginning  of  the  indefinite
quantity  o.     The  second  term,  which  here  is  — ,  will  denote  the  difference
between  CH  and  DN  ;  that  is,  the  lineola  MN  which  is  cut  off  by  com
pleting  the  parallelogram  HC  DM;  and  therefore  always  determines  the CM?
position  of  the  tangent  HN  ;  as,  in  this  case,  by  taking  MN  to  HM  as  — G
to  o,  or  a  to  e.  The  third  term,  which  here  is  -£—,  will  represent  the  li
neola  IN,  which  lies  between  the  tangent  and  the  curve  ;  and  therefore
determines  the  angle  of  contact  IHN,  or  the  curvature  which  the  curve  line

has  in  H.  If  that  lineola  IN  is  of  a  finite  magnitude,  it  will  be  expressed
by  the  third  term,  together  with  those  that  follow  in  wfinitu:.:i.  But  if
that  lineola  be  diminished  in.  infini-
tnm,  the  terms  following  become  in
finitely  less  than  the  third  term,  and
therefore  may  be  neglected.  The
fourth  term  determines  the  variation
of  the  curvature  ;  the  fifth,  the  varia
tion  of  the  variation  ;  and  so  on.
Whence,  by  the  way,  appears  no  con-p~"   ~K     B~C~D~E~

semi-diameter  AF  standing  perpendicularly  on  PQ  :  and  the  resistance
will  be  to  the  gravity  as  3a  to  2>/,  that  is,  as  SAC  to  the  diameter  PQ  of
the  circle;  and  the  velocity  will  be  as  i/  CH.  Therefore  if  the  body  goes
from  the  place  F,  with  a  due  velocity,  in  the  direction  of  a  line  parallel  to
PQ,  and  the  density  of  the  medium  in  each  of  the  places  H  is  as  the  length
of  the  tangent  HT,  and  the  resistance  also  in  any  place  H  is  to  the  force
of  gravity  as  SAC  to  PQ,  that  body  will  describe  the  quadrant  FHQ  of  a
circle.  Q.E.I.
But  if  the  same  body  should  go-frorn  the  place  P,  in  the  direction  of  a
line  perpendicular  to  PQ,  and  should  begin  to  move  in  an  arc  of  the  semi
circle  PFQ,  we  must  take  AC  or  a  on  the  contrary  side  of  the  centre  A  ;
and  therefore  its  sign  must  be  changed,  and  we  must  put —  a  for  +  a.
Then  the  density  of  the  medium  would  come  out  as    .      But  nature
does  not  admit  of  a  negative  density,  that  is,  a  density  which  accelerates
the  motion  of  bodies;  and  therefore  it  cannot  naturally  come  to  pass  that
a  body  by  ascending  from  P  should  describe  the  quadrant  PF  of  a  circle.
To  produce  such  an  effect,  a  body  ought  to  be  accelerated  by  an  impelling
medium,  and  not  impeded  by  a  resisting  one.
EXAMPLE  2.  Let  the  line  PFQ  be  a  parabola,  having  its  axis  AF  per-

pendicular  to  the  horizon  PQ,  to  find  the  density  of  the  medium,  which
will  make  a  projectile  move  in  that  line.
From  the  nature  of  the  parabola,  the  rectangle  PDQ,
is  equal  to  the  rectangle  under  the  ordinate  DI  and  some
given  right  line  ;  that  is,  if  that  right  line  be  called  b  ;

for  Q,o,  and  the  third  term  -r  for  Roo.      But  since  there  are  no   more
terms,  the  co-efficient  S  of  the  fourth  term  will  vanish  ;  and  therefore  the

tional,  will  be  nothing.     Therefore,  where  the  medium  is  of  no  density,
the  projectile  will  move  in  a  parabola  ;  as  Galileo  hath  heretofore  demon
strated.     Q.E.I.
EXAMPLE  3.  Let  the  line  AGK  be  an  hyperbola,  having  its  asymptote
